1	the bourne ultimatum  ( 2007 )  review :  after a thrilling set of two ,  we get the final installment .  here's my take :   the bourne ultimatum has it all .  we have jason bourne ( matt damon )  on the coattails of the ones who know everything .  he has been running for too long .  this time ,  it ends .   the bourne ultimatum has a great plot ,  awesome writing ,  fantastic direction ,  suspense ,  and some of the best action of the summer .  matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date .  he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin .   there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense .  the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing ( in a good way )  or cheering on .   ( or both )  i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping .  the audience was loving it .   the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package .  all of the goods and then some .  this is ,  in my opinion the best movie this summer .   the last word :  excellent conclusion .  the best of the trilogy .  this is how summer movie thrillers should be done .  i love the bourne trilogy . 
1	hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr .  sebastian caine  ( kevin bacon )  finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum .  they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly ,  caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human .  he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible ,  however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible .  the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works ,  caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory .  but then again he's invisible right ,  he can do anything he wants .  .  .   directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man .  you know it's just after christmas ,  i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick ,  not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief .  the script by andrew w .  marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise ,  it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man  ( 1933 )  film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit .  it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror ,  sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes .  i thought the character's were ok ,  i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety ,  the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself .  then of course there's the gore ,  he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits ,  to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it .  having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me ,  it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea .   director verhoeven does a great job ,  or should that be the special effects boys make him look good .  the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless ,  their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that .  there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top .  i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins ,  organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla .  there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten ,  someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results .   with a staggering budget of about $95 , 000 , 000 hollow man is technically faultless ,  i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they ?  the acting was ok ,  bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy .   hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film ,  well i know i do .  good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product ,  definitely worth a watch . 
1	since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english ,  i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing ( 2000 )  as presented in the bandai released dvd set .  my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of  "  " shin kidô senki gundam w "  ( 1995 )  .   very little is changed in respect to plot ,  script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in .  purists can stick to japanese all they want ,  but for a more  " realistic "  experience i recommend the english track since all the characters ,  except heero yuy ,  are not japanese .  ( most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians .  )  for one thing ,  the characters' personalities come across more  " directly "  than in the japanese version .  the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors .   wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity .  voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as  " bad acting "  but it matches heero's personality very well .   deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ,  ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends .  he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show ,  masterfully played by scott mcneil .  he may sound a little too old for his age ,  but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one .   trowa ,  the pilot of heavyarms ,  is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat ;  despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him ,  he only knows how to kill ,  not to befriend .  kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton .   quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand .  a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl ( and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version )  but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy .   the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa .   relena darlian sounds older in english ,  voiced by lisa ann bailey .  this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story ,  her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development .   zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version .  both voices bring out different sides to the same character .  his japanese voice is haughty ,  authoritative and commands respect  ,  keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature .  his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued ,  sounding more devious and  " snake-like "  ,  highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals .   the members of oz are a mixed bag really .  treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking .  however ,  lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . bored most of the time .  the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either .   i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds .  the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents .  the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility .   despite underwhelming acting from the side characters ,  the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script .  very faithful to the original japanese script ,  keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics ,  war and human nature .  sadly ,  it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script . 
0	oh dear .  .  .  as an englishman ,  and a small part welsh ,  a fan of anthony hopkins' work in the industry .  .  .  .  .  to date ,  i am truly disappointed .    you see i am a nobody ,  who hoped for better .  so my comments are as 'straw in the wind' .  but ,  that's the point isn't it ?  - i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work .  i ,  a full member of the great unwashed ,  go to see a movie to be transported to another place .  to yes ,  suspend belief for a brief period .  but not to enter a state of total disbelief .   had this been by an unknown author and director ,  i would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion .  unfortunately ,  its not ,  and i was left wide eyed and confused .  having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am faintly worried .  .  .  .   perhaps its that i try ,  without prejudice ,  to view each movie on its own merits .  regardless of author ,  director ,  studio or even the notoriety of the content .   my advice ,  as many before me :  don't write and direct the same production .  it is fraught with danger .  movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility .   as they say in school reports  " could and can do better .  .  .  " 
1	following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use .  the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah's erratic persona which ,  beyond general insensitivity ,  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on ,  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene .  sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed .  every time she speaks it's like a self-contained 5 second skit .  she overemotes a lot ,  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify ,  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied .  this may be the most creative ,  original and experimental tv program ever . 
1	although too young to remember the first showing of the series  ( being just a baby )  i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80's ,  just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects .  it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests ,  relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific .  since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era ,  with mixed opinions .  the british television stations are generally very good at producing these ,  as the world at war can easily attest ,  with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies .  i strongly recommend such titles as  " the nazis - a warning from history "  ,   " blitz "  and the bbc series about dunkirk .   " britain at war in colour "  ,  with its companion series  " japan "  ,   " germany "  and  " america "  are of a very high standard .  the world at war is by far the best and ,  despite its age ,  never fails to deliver .  there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously aren't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other ,  even if such an undertaking was even possible .  what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war can't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable .  that certainly worked for me :  i now have a very comprehensive library of books ,  videos ,  dvds and tapes and cds .  recommend to anyone with even a passing interest .  the series was so well made that they'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative . 
1	this is a very strange film by director/animator richard williams .  all who know of william's work know it's a bit off-kilter  ( if not ingenious )  but this one takes the cake .   it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way .  the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality ;  its strange character designs ,  its powerful animation ,  and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary .  williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls ,  floppy and darned ,  rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls ,  which made it more believable  ( at least in a visual sense )  .  the animation shines on the bring us the camel-with-the-wrinkled-knees ,  whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end ,  the silent-movie chase with sir leonard looney and ,  of course ,  the greedy .   the greedy animation ,  on its own ,  is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen .  there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new .  living in what was deemed  " the taffy pit ,  "  the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets .  he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones ,  then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart .   the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs .  it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them .  there are about six good songs  ( which should have been the only ones )  including  " i look ,  and what do i see ?  "  ,   " no girl's toy "  ,   " blue "   ( though they didn't need to make him sing it twice )  ,   " i never get enough "  ,   " because i love you "  and maybe  " i'm home .  "  the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to .   this is a weird film with strange undertones ,  but if that's what you're looking for ,  you won't find better . 
1	i am a fan of animal movies .  if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over .  homeward bound did just this .  they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it .  it was a complete success .  it is very much an archetypal movie .  you have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow )  who is wise and logical ,  you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance ,  and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised .  these three personalities bounce off of each other very well .  i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters ,  and they did not overdue it .  most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film .  what they are forgetting ,  however ,  is that it is supposed to be a kids film ,  and this still does not take away from the acual movie .  this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie .  it is a disney movie without the cartoons ,  an air bud movie with a better plot .  i would ,  without a doubt ,  advise you to watch it . 
0	one of the those  " coming of age "  films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids .  this movie has neither .  it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel's body double frolic with a dorky eric brown .  to make matters worse ,  the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny ,  sexy ,  or dramatic .  laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard .  ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double .  as the movie went on and on ,  i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp .  watch this to laugh at other people's stupidity ,  or for ed begley jr . 's committed performance ,  or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt .  but i can give you an idea of your lesson ,  stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle . 
0	no likeable characters  ( the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allen/paul provensa/reiser )  and the contrived scenes  ( did anyone really think thiat kid on the rollerblades was not going to knock the guy down ?  )  were just sickeningly bad .   
0	i won't describe the story ,  as that has been done elsewhere .  we are great clive owen fans ,  and when our netflix recommended the movie ,  we were intrigued .    no wonder we had never heard of this  " movie "  ,  because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 .  hence ,  the poor production values ,  grainy image  ,  jerky camera work and poor sound .   but ,  you don't really mind the mechanics ,  because the story itself will put you to sleep .  it's an interesting human story ,  but not at all compelling ,  and there is hardly any ending .  you don't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie .  save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile . 
0	sam  ( thomas cavanagh )  and gray  ( heather graham )  are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things -- ballroom dancing ,  1940s movie musicals and ,  much to their surprise ,  an attractive woman named charlie  ( bridget moynahan )  .  historically heterosexual ,  gray is confused by her new feelings .   gray matters proves to be one of the blandest films i have ever seen .  it's dull ,  predictable ,  unfunny ,  poorly acted and poorly written .  nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy .  also ,  this isn't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a  " coming out "  movie .  sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part .  unfortunately ,  she failed miserably .  the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little .  then ,  the film took an awkward tone and got all serious .  the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony .   i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic .  the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn't really appear to be that close .  their relationship just didn't feel very natural .  also ,  the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural .  if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week ,  then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are .  there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters .   the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast .  heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie .  she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it's too bad that all of her co-stars were complete duds .  bridget moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level .  also ,  it seemed like she was reading her lines .  thomas cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion .  the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony .  i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying .  sissy spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them .  finally ,  alan cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn't very good .  overall ,  gray matters is a lame film and it isn't worth watching .  rating 3/10
1	this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way .  dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives .    laced with dreams - dripping in reality ,  the american dream reignites after 9 . 11 with a true story about the devil ray's mid-life rookie ,  jimmy morris .  australian born actress ,  rachel griffiths ,  plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know ;  and dennis quaid was perfection  cast as the wannabe ,  gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience .  it's real .  the on-screen chemistry works .  if you like baseball heart-warmers ,  you're going to love this film .  the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there .  my popcorn became the a la mode' .    and hey :  buy the cd !  the music rocks and carries the story magnificently !  syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should ,  an area that disappoints me more often than not .   criticisms :  i'd have given the baseball to somebody else .  but quaid has something to teach us all about character' and heart .  st .  rita and the nuns were a nice decoration ,  but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them .  a little long .  worth every minute in the last analysis .  8 / 10 .    
1	the movie is a fantasy .  the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully .   ( i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well .  )  some of the dialog is wonderfully clever .  the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942 .   movies are designed to serve various purposes .  this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does .  if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count .  some of the closeups made me uncomfortable .  but he could still sing and sing magnificently .  however ,  jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever .  she makes a spectacular angel .   this genre is well before my time ,  and i an new to the jeanette macdonald/nelson eddy films and related conversation .  the music in this movie is beautiful .  as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies ,  there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable ,  more delightful ,  better constructed .  the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today .  and jeanette macdonald ,  without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons ,  was more beautiful than the stars i see today .  i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies .  they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is .  and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what ?  i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten .  there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed .  i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent ,  great beauty and great music . 
1	the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia  ( brooke adames )  & bradley marshall  ( jeff hayenga )  who have tried for the last five years to conceive ,  virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child .  they visit dr .  richard meyerling  ( james karen )  for help after he is recommended by some of their friends ,  dr .  meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child .  dr .  meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant .  at first everything seems perfect & the marshall's couldn't be happier ,  but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems ,  she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth  ( jane cameron )  ,  another woman who has undergone dr .  meyerling's procedure ,  who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher .  virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her .  .  .   produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller  ( it's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe )  that pleasantly surprised me .  the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least .  the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects ,  it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears .  it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means .  the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then ,  maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't .  on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times .  also ,  i have to mention it ,  what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh ?  !   director flender does an ok job ,  the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough .  the atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr .  meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment .  disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens ,  the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it .   technically the film is ok ,  i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable .  the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement .  the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends  ( 1994 - 2004 )  star lisa kudrow ,  i have to be honest i don't like friends & i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did .   the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen ,  it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves .  if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different ,  something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn .  followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii  ( 1994 )  which i watched straight after this ,  check my review out if you want .  . 
0	notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero .  as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest .  i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake .  but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen .   the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best .  do not let that fool you .  this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world .   the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it .  the acting  ( if you can call it that )  ,  the  " plot "   ( so many holes must look like swiss cheese )  ,  and the special effects really are just terrible .   please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch .   in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this ,  but i am thinking it . 
0	insignificant and low-brained  ( haha !  )  80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen ,  yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind .  the special effects are tacky ,  the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs !   " the brain "  takes place in a typical quiet-american town setting ,  where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet .  it is here that a tv-guru named dr .  blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling .  under the label of  " independent thinkers "  ,  a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill !  how cool is that ?  now ,  it's up to the meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world !  the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr .  blake and his monstrous brain actually come from .  there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it .  meh ,  who needs a background in a movie like this ,  really ?  there's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the  " evil "  brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet .  the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie .  director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made  " bloody birthday "   ( guilty pleasure of mine )  and  " plague "  .  both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry .  the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale ,  whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re-animator .  a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent she has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which this is her  " masterpiece "  .  in her debut ,  she was credited as 'runaway model' and in  " 3 men and a baby "  ,  her character is referred to as 'one of jack's girls' .  i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress
0	mike brady  ( michael garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic  " the warriors "  )  is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town .  not just any slugs ,  mind you ,  but carnivorous killer bigger then normal ,  mutated by toxic waste slugs  ( who still only go as fast as a normal slug ,  which isn't that frightening ,  but i digress )  .  no one will believe him at first ,  but they will .  oh yes ,  they will .   ok ,  killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below johnathon winters as mork's baby in the creepiness factor .  so the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go .  the flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety .  i appreciate that they spelled out that this was slugs :  the movie as opposed to slugs :  the children's game or slugs :  the other white meat .  probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game .  director juan piquer simón is more widely known for his previous films  " pod people "   ( which mst3k deservedly mocked )  and  " peices "   ( which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made )    eye candy :  kari rose shows t&a   my grade :  d+   dvd extras :  merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
1	winchester 73 is the story of a man  ( jimmy stewart )  obsessed with getting back his prized possession ,  a repeating rifle made by winchester .  the rifle keeps changing hands ,  and stewart doggedly keeps after it .  this 1950 b&w effort by anthony mann is more a crime film than a traditional western ,  and the cowboys often seem more like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys .  shelley winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man  ( charles drake )  she may marry .  she ends up falling for stewart ,  but not before she is passed around a bit .  winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters .  watch for a young dan dureyea as a nutty killer and tony curtis in a very small role .  a woefully miscast will geer plays wyatt earp . 
0	welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare .  this horror tale finds a newly married husband ( john hudson ) and wife ( peggy weber ) haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond .  is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane ?  or is it the learning challenged gardener mickey ( alex nicol ) who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house ?  this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale .  special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards .  i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie .  also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway .  by the way .  .  . the lurking gardener ( nicol ) is the film's director .  you can catch this as part of amc's monsterfest .

0	this film was terrible .  ok ,  my favourite film is 'the wicker man'  ( 1973 )  ,  so i was always bound to be a little biased .    the plot rambles along ,  throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious .   ( he's not a virgin ,  but is allergic to bees .  wow !  )  so many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained ,  which i'm afraid mr labute does not a horror movie make .   ( how are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film ?  )  cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout ,  and his character is prone to calling out  " rowan !  ?  "  at the slightest noise .  the 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage .  for example ,  certain incidents mirror the original  ( the girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when woodward/cage is searching the island )  and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from anthony schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in .   i'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this ,  i really can't be bothered to write any more about this film .  it lacks any kind of substance .  throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on  ( in this case very loosely )  . 
0	i got the dvd very cheap and i'm a total drewbie ,  and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone .   an early drew movie ,  she's looking great ,  and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her ,  like a shower scene ,  a sexy dance scene ,  quite a number of sexy outfits etc .  she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies .   the movie itself is pretty average or sub-average ,  and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema .  there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy .   the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it .  but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway .  but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting ,  and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected .   overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies . 
1	i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day ,  after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven .  not really a fan of either star ,  i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller fan .   i was not disappointed .  the acting was superb ,  especially from the two young boys .  usually i loathe child actors ,  but young adam and young fenton were excellent .  bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too .  it was beautifully shot .   one must also note the plot twists .  the three twists at the end hit hard and fast ,  and i didn't see them coming .  the final twist of the film ,  coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed ,  gives me chills to this day ,  even though i've re-watched the film so many times .   a true gem . 
1	gotta start with ed furlong on this one .  you gotta .  god bless this kid .  $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life .  he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script .  you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting .  maybe that's why his performance was good .  same with madsen .  you keep thinking ,   " i bet this guy is really like this in real life .  "  does madsen even have to act ?  just natural .  vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy .  i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance .  her reactions are spot-on in this film .  i battled if she was hot or not ,  but realized i would just like to see more of her .    not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films .  but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing .  it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank ,  they kill hostages ,  and the good guys win in the end type of film .  the twists keep on coming .  .  . and coming .   the café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there .  not glossed over a bit .  think like bourne ultimatum  " lite "  style on some scenes in the café .   and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne  ( who plays karl )  will make you do a double take .  these guys are twins .   as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town .  made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents .  but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of .  and some of them are smoking hot .  moncia dean ?  need i say more . 
0	this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers ,  eating pizza ,  and laugh at .  unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone .  my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one .  it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it .  so i did ,  and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is .   now ,  i love bad movies quite a bit ,  and i probably would have liked this one if the  " hero "  wasn't so utterly loathsome .  the entire movie i was hoping that he'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him !  he does very little heroic things in the movie .  he's a beefy ,  disgusting ,  stupid thing .  he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do .  and what was it with all the naked chicks ?  i mean ,  i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy ,  but this movie went a tad overboard in that department .   well ,  anyway ,  if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting  " hero "  then i'm sure you'll like this schlock of a film . 
0	no wonder this was released straight to dvd here in australia ,  no redeeming features what so ever .  the dialog was hokey ,  the acting ,  awful and the script sucked !  !  whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior john badham film ,  wargames from the 80s ,  well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea !  !  amanda walsh was good in it as the eye candy/love interest ,  while matt lanter was good as the other main lead- that is about it .  i would not recommend wargames :  the dead code to anyone ,  check out hackers or the original wargames film- both are better than this piece of crap !  ! 
1	this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films .  it is another solid based-on-a-true store ,  which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes .  frankly ,  i don't know but i liked the story .   the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else ,  including his father ,  does in this west virginia town .  the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father ,  which i think was overdone .  i would like to have a little less tension between the two .   the young man ,  still a boy ,  is played by jake gyllenhaal ,  one of his first staring assignments ,  i think .  he's likable ,  as are his school buddies in here .  it's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film .  the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper  ( the dad )  and laura dern  ( the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time .  )   the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear .  once again :  i wish there more of these kind of films made today . 
0	i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment .  i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled ,  let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma .  some scenes seemed promising ,  playing with visual dimensions ,  but couldn't hold up the rest .  i felt like i was stoned for the first time again ,  having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents .   what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights .  i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn ,  without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor ,  also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves .   gert de graff is not jean-luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be . 
1	the film concerns a classic theme .  in fact it concerns the theme exploited by batman ,  from beginning to end ,  but in real data and details .  the mayor of new york ,  appreciated and very diligent and dynamic ,  in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal ,  yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed ,  be it only because of the political value it represents .  and what was to happen happens and a few people ,  including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal .  the city may explode because of it :  racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public .  unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out .  but along the way a few witnesses are killed ,  and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire  ( the judge )  ,  to end their career and life  ( the contractor or the contractor's go between )  ,  a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report ,  and some shady character after he provides some crucial information .  the mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation ;  but the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case .  the political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions .  we are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest .  we are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city .  that is not typical of new york .  that is true in any mayoral office .  it is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like new york and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives .  the young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way ,  and he derails his ambition to be the governor of new york in order to become the president of the us .  the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless .  i find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name .  that seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way .  hence he is not better than all the others ,  just still too young in his ambition .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine ,  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
0	 " dominique "  is one of those films that the expression  " slow-as-molasses "  must have been invented for .  too many endless and repetitive sequences  ( how many times do we see robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano ?  )  .  it is almost redeemed at the end by a surprising twist ,  which ,  unfortunately ,  is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths .  not a very enjoyable film . 
1	i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 ,  when it was shown in combination with the red balloon .  both films are similar in their dream-like quality .  the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner ,  a little boy ,  is away at school .  a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are ,  and begins to warily stalk his  " prey .  "  the boy begins his walk home from school ,  and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend .  the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence ,  and finally jumps out of the bowl !  the cat quickly walks over to the fish ,  gently picks him up with his paws ,  and returns him to his bowl .  the boy returns happily to his fish ,  none the wiser .   the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity .  it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003 .   if you can find it ,  watch it -- you won't be disappointed !  and if you *do* find it ,  let me know so i can get a copy ,  too ! 
1	after racism ,  rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s .  westside story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view .  now ,  midnight cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view .  it has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away .   director john schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts ,  dreams ,  fantasies ,  fears and evaluations of two new york city scums .  while the handsome joe buck ( voight )  dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy ,  the poor ratso rizzo ( hoffman )  dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny florida .  accordingly ,  joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality ;  and ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into florida .  besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can .  they begin sharing everything in life .  they share food ,  they share medicine ,  they share an uninhabited home ,  they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny .  regrettably as the story progresses ,  joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun ;  and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there .   the might is always right ,  and the feeble has no right in the daylight .  thence ,   " midnight "  gives the factual sight .   despite the tragedy ,  there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy .  every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate .  thanks to this ,  midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue ,  the rural exodus . 
1	joshua seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests :  the corporations effect on war .   the film is about a mercenary  ( john cusack )  traveling to turaqistan  ( not a real country ,  fyi )  to help the american government 'get their message across' to turaqistan's leaders .  he meets a reporter  ( marisa tomei )  and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter .  somewhere in the mix ,  a pop star named yonica babyyeah gets thrown in .  as yonica is marrying one of turaquistan's most important people  ( a son of the president )  ,  a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star ,  well ,  somewhat .  the film starts off with a lonely cusack in a bar ;  no more than fifteen seconds later ,  the film hooks you .  with it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics ,  the film's running time blows by you .  the film has a lot more action than i expected ,  with the occasional scene of war ,  well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder .  though the story isn't much deep ,  the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike .   in the final act of the film ,  the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled .  i thought it was executed very well ,  but other may disagree ,  and i could understand why .  twist after twist is what the ending is all about ,  and like most films ,  it is a true hit/miss situation .  regardless ,  the three writers on the film  ( mark leyner ,  jeremy pikser & john cusack )  did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas .   joshua seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity ;  not reducing the material to the most redundant of films  ( which i was afraid would happen )  .  seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could :  he created a vibrant atmosphere ,  one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities ;  - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all .  seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely .  no missteps here .  hopefully ,  he takes on more directorial jobs ,  for he is one director to look out for . 
1	parker  ( johnathan schaech )  is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break .  in the meantime ,  he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline .  one day ,  most unfortunately ,  his apartment building burns down .  parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple .  word comes to parker that a lady ,  samantha  ( alison eastwood )  is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male .  since parker is straight but the price is right ,  he decides to pretend that he is gay .  samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant .  but ,  poor parker .  sam is lovely ,  intelligent and very desirable .  how will he be able to keep his true nature under control ?  besides ,  doesn't sam have a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway ?  this is a sweet ,  likable ,  and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech .  naturally ,  the plot is a string of  " how can i keep up this ruse "  scenes ,  with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news .  also ,  it is necessary for parker to produce his own  " fake "  gay mate ,  boris ,  when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows .  hopefully ,  the gay community will not find this too offensive ,  as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety .  for a small scale movie ,  the costumes ,  sets ,  and camera work were quite nice ,  also .  therefore ,  if you love those funny tales of love ,  get this one soon .  you will like what you see ,  i know it . 
0	star rating :  ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning   the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other .  a renegade pilot  ( steve touissant )  steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it .  so they are forced to send in their best man john sands  ( seagal ,  who else ?  )  to stop him ,  in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years .   i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought .  but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man  ( by the same director )  wasn't bad and ,  what the hell ,  seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe ,  just maybe ,  he could make a great film again .  oh what a fool i was .   dubbing ,  horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets ,  awful camera work ,  cheap production values ,  risible ,  unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal's trademark and a boring ,  sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere .   thankfully his next film ,  once upon a time in the hood  ( which i'll be skipping )  ,  apparently marks the end of his contract with sony ,  meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres .  hell ,  he's done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him  ( rocky balboa .  )    this isn't a flight of fury .  it isn't even a flight of fun .  it's a flight that fails to even take off the ground .  *
1	* firstly ,  although many say it is the worst of the series ,  i don't think that it is true , considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality  . it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do .   * i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays aren't supposed to be for teenagers ? i mean .  .  .  cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out ;  plus  , seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good time .   * many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie .  well .  .  . let's get real .  .  . doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie ?  what would you like to see .  .  . smart books , romantic stuff ?  that is not at all what would be in those teenagers' minds  .  .  .   * to conclude ,  i think that if you are a teenager ,  you must absolutely see the movie ,  and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman ,  you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager , or things like that .  thanks for reading ! 
1	excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years .  starting around 1910 ,  he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood ;  his family ,  friends ,  romances ,  etc .  very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale .  .  .  .  " all things in life come together as one ,  and a river runs through it .  and that river haunts me .  "  worth seeing . 
0	wow ,  i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done .  however ,  this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video .    to give you a couple of examples :    1 .  david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker ,  however ,  this had little visual artistic content  ( blank walls ,   " up shots "  with ceiling in the background )    2 .  david lynch typically takes great pride in audio ,  however ,  in this you could even hear the video camera's hum .    in fact ,  it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie .  unless .  .  .    .  .  . this is a joke ,  on david's part ,  to force fans search his website  ( for hours )  only to find this drivel .  i hope so ,  because at least that idea is funny . 
0	the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like star trek .  that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner .  they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show .  because of this ,  a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes  ( the good and the bad )  because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive .  now ,  it's time to do the same for the twilight zone .   while i have scored many episodes 10 ,  this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad .  the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad .  two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode .  after a while ,  it's apparent that they are the only two people left on earth--as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion .  usually the twist at the end makes the episode great--this one killed it ! 
0	warning spoilers***** a really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls .  one of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon .  it's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse .   a waste of time for the viewers ,  as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on ,  the gore is ludicrous at best ,  and the acting is terrible ,  perfect pairing for such a bad script  
1	in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be :  children's .  they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie  ( meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st )  taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch .  sequels usually make me nervous ,  however this one did pretty well for itself .  knowing that it didn't have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead .  the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience ,  if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it ,  but if you want to watch a simple ,  fun ,  energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one . 
0	what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make ,  running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate .  the whole production feels cheap and shabby ,  and it's not helped by a  " big name "  star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion .   at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material ;  they're clearly watching the clock here .  bang out the scenes ,  get the pay cheque ,  go home ,  and try to forget all about it .   it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed ;  there are no real clangers ,  it's just utterly anodyne ,  and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras .  the pacing is a little bizarre ;  an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts ,  which makes it feel irrelevant .   maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored ,  and for being a fun game of  " spot the kiwi bit parters "  ;  most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena :  warrior princess .  the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break . 
0	not very impressed .  its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film ,  because there is almost no development in the plot .  everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry .  the acting seems very poor as well ,  and reminds me of the old black and white maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television .  although this is difficult to tell with the female role ,  yuwen ,  as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin .  it reminds me of fading star gong li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a scowl on her face all the time .    tian zhuangzhuang's film the 'blue kite' was a far better film .  but don't be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s .  unlike the blue kite ,  the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself ,  the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop .   i wonder whether tian zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial .   if any film fits the description of 'overrated , ' this is it .  i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry . 
1	fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale  ( big edie )  and her daughter  ( little edie )  aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis .  they live in a rodent infested ,  rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city .  it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric .  little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 .  the content is pretty much made up of two things .  the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer ,  actress ,  and dancer .  these discussions usually become very rhetorical ,  nonsensical ,  and often times amusing .  the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties .  each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad .  in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling .  very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it .  the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus ,  coming each day to record  ( and chuckle )  at whatever bizarre behavior may come about .  ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by .  their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in .  despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever .  for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness .  most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom .  her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable . 
0	i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie !  the lines ,  pacing ,  and timing of events in that film are outstanding !  however ,  this european vacation sequel is a major let down .   in this sequel ,  the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show .  the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild ,   " ha-ha "  laughs .  for example ,  a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark ,   " do you want your coke in the can ?  "  clark answers back ,   " no ,  i'll have it right here .  "  that's really about the only line that is funny in this film .   european vacation's humor is strained .  as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie ,  tried to re-hash a script that had been done before ,  and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time .   worse ,  the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found .  their replacements are not funny ,  can't act ,  and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time .  there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny ,  they are in bad taste .   the griswald's should have stayed in wally world .  the place that made them legends !  don't join them on this european dreadful adventure .  viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this !  you'll be glad you did . 
0	this may be the worst show i've ever seen .  aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about hitler ,  it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way .  it is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations ,  but while it can be well done like in i love lucy ,  it's just not funny here .  i think the show was based around the novelty  " look ,  it's hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure "  but it just fell flat in every regard .  the guy playing hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone .  i wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air .  i thought america had some tasteless show ,  but the brits had us beat this time .  america would never air a sitcom about hitler ,  although we did have that show about lincoln's slave ,  the secret diary of desmond pfeiffer .  chances are you'll probably never see this show ,  since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on dvd . 
1	walter matthau and george burns just work so well together .  the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven .  the scene when they meet again in willy's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection .  walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can ,  the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization .  george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film ,  his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable .  watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker ,  and al's reaction - priceless . 
1	 " midnight cowboy "  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in america .  its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial .  no wonder it was a huge success when initially released .  but be warned ,  its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made .  the characters are memorable ,  well-developed ,  and ultimately tragic .  the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending ,  something which was basically mandatory by the 80s .  still ,  this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film .  its a time when well-made ,  innovative ,  and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer .  all this was over by the time  " star wars "  was released .   the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work .  it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing .  unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects ,   " midnight cowboy "  has aged quite well .  its still as powerful now as it was when initially released .  the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece .  the characters' backgrounds are never fully explained ,  but the performances make them completely developed .  both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic  ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions )  .  plus ,  being a fan of vintage exploitation films ,  i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street .   " midnight cowboy "  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made .   ( 10/10 ) 
0	watched this film having really enjoyed gregory's girl many years ago .  this was drivel .  the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts .  previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter ,  but i found it rather nasty .  if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils .  we were surprised that the censor let that through .  apart from that the film was just a waste of time .  the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image ,  slightly wacky and off the wall .  why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible .  this film failed on all counts for me .  dreadful .  please don't waste your time watching it .  life's too short
1	possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career ,  and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility ,  charisma ,  and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting . 
0	this is crap .  .  .  . utter crap .  i cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this .  full moon has a number of awful films ,  but this has got to be the worst .  first off ,  the plot doesn't exist .  it's odd .  it's like ,  they took an idea for the story ,  and kind of never really got around to developing it .  they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two  " heroes "  drove around in the desert ,  and bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes .  there were two scenes in the movie  ( when dez and dazzy are driving ,  and when dez and bradbury are driving )  where it just went on and on and on .  .  . it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action .  they just drove for about 5 minutes ,  with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape .   next ,  we come to the acting ,  which is simply horrible .  first off ,  the girl who plays dazzy is just a beast .  she is so scary looking ,  i wanted to look away when she was on screen !  horrible casting .  then ,  you have the guy who played dez ,  who couldn't act if his life depended on it .  his  " crying "  is actually funny ,  and his madman antics are even funnier .  the guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad ,  as is the guy who plays bradbury .  there was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever .   the makeup effects .  .  . hmmm ,  can anyone say pathetic ?  the  " effects "  were so fake ,  they were laughable .  the crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone ,  they cut away ,  and when they come back ,  the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound .  nice .  did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what ?  !  i must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment .  .  . nice makeup there too .  i think they were going for a drugged look ,  and i think she was supposed to have a black guy ,  but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween .   this movie is just horrible from the start .  the story is stupid and very ,  very unoriginal ,  the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old ,  the acting is the lowest of the low ,  and so on .  stay away from this movie at all costs .  it's only 70 minutes long in the first place ,  and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel .  do not waste your time on this piece of garbage . 
0	this film sold for one-dollar at wal-mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film ,  except my time .  enjoyed the acting of tom hanks ,   ( robbie wheeling )  ,  who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script .  the story is about college students who decided to play the game mazes & monsters ,  only in a very realistic setting .  robbie wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades .  robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game ,  he stops making love to her and acts like a monk .  there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area .  it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world .  this is not a very good film ,  except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment . 
0	i hate to be the one to rain on a parade  ( even a small one like this )  but from the very first scene ,  you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite .  its a shame really ,  as i quite like martin freeman and danny dyer .  i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together ,  but to my dismay ,  they did not even have a scene together !  !  i think i need to repeat this - the two lead actors  ( who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and dvd covers )  did not have one scene together !  !  !  !  they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time .  just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie .  false advertisement .   the dialogue was painful ,  every single character in the movie was unrealistic ,  and un-human like .  the scenarios were far fetched ,  the plot was crap ,  the jokes were thin ,  freeman tried too hard to be funny  ( and played a poor mans tim from the office )  ,  nobody was likable ,  and worst of all ,  some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off ,  as i couldn't bear to watch ,  or listen to them any longer .   this low budget stinker was an epic fail .  even danny dyer couldn't inject some humour and charm into this ,  but bless ,  he tried .  what a waste of time .   how anybody could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me .  ten stars ?  seriously ?  come on .  .  .  . i won't even give some of the greats ten stars ,  as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect .  this film was far from perfect ,  almost the opposite ,  meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout .   watch it if you like ,  but if you've seen a lot of movies ,  and watched a lot of great movies ,  your review will probably similar to mine .   1/10
0	considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy's creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting .  however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it .  first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience ,  in a public area .  so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment .  but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced .  they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing .  i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell's performance because i found he didn't make a believable john doe .  an other problem was the police story .  it really felt like déjà vu and it wasn't a pleasant sensation .  it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch ,  the episodic format .  i could already see the fillers coming one after an other .   so overall i was very disappointed by it and don't recommend it to anyone .  considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled .  in some way i have the impression that it missed its target ,  developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity .  it's sad because there was potential ,  like the people he met at the club .  the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct .  but i'll never know if it got better ,  probably not ,  because i don't plan to watch the next episode . 
0	two kinds of movies we like are  ( 1 )  westerns ,  and  ( 2 )  movies from 30 or 40 years ago .  we ought to have liked a man called sledge ;  but .  .  .  .  .   but .  .  .  this picture is disagreeable ,  annoying and stupid from start to finish .  since there is nobody in the story  ( good or bad )  to warm up to ,  there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested .  no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold ,  and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it .  sledge has a pretty girl friend ,  but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig .   the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score ,  and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow .   of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault ,  this was the rock bottom ,  the only true dud in the bunch . 
1	this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid .  there is really not much i'd need or want to say here .  except maybe  " see this film "  and  " enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal "  ,  who carries you through this neat ,  funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day !    seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day = my life !  it appears ,  that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do .  either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming tv-shows and ballgames .  what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference .  about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - now !   ( on the eighth day )  .  .  .  at least that was what i got from 'the eighth day' . 
0	here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film ,  a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so .  i've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies ,  including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie ,  and as much as i hate to be redundant ,  the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything .  the punch bowl over poor jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie  ( `hey everyone ,  this is the director ,  and the following is my carrie-rip-off scene .  enjoy ! ' )  .  but that's just a suggestion .    ( spoilers )  the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured .  we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning ,  she gets killed ,  people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone ,  and then they start to get killed .  the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful ,  but they have no idea how to do it .  take jason ,  for example .  here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had ,  and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated ,  he is assumed to carry some significance .  besides that ,  and more importantly ,  he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade ,  and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine's day cards .    it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects ,  and jason is a perfect example of the effort ,  but not such a good example of a successful effort .  sure ,  i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer ,  but that's not the point .  we know from early on that he is terrible with women ,  which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film ,  but then in the middle of the film ,  he appears at a party ,  smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls ,  and then gives them a hateful look and walks away ,  disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation .  we already know he is a cardboard character ,  but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him .   on the positive side ,  the killer's true identity was ,  in fact ,  made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also ,  unfortunately ,  yet another rip-off .  early in the film ,  when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel ,  he makes no sound ,  suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female ,  rather than a male as everyone suspects .  but then for the rest of the film ,  we just have this stolid ,  relentless ,  unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife .  director jamie blanks  ( who ,  with all due respect ,  looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade )  mentions being influenced by halloween .  this is ,  of course ,  completely unnecessary ,  because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film .  the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer's is that michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds .  this stuff is shameless .    at the end ,  there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is  ( complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal )  ,  but then we see adam's nose start to bleed as he holds kate ,  his often reluctant girlfriend ,  and we know that he's been the killer all along .  nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act ,  and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film .  valentine is not scary  ( i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight ,  and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember ,  and even i wasn't scared )  ,  and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die .  i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews  ( although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than battlefield earth )  ,  but the end result is the same old thing . 
1	this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview ,  jackie said it was his favorite as well .  it contains some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes as well .  this movie was a favorite of brandon lee ,  who used parts in rapid fire ,  and was also lifted in tango and cash ,  which used some of the opening scenes .   jackie plays a policeman in hong kong .  the story immediately jumps into a fantastic chase through a shanty town and continues as jackie slides down a hill and jumps onto a moving bus to catch the evil ku  ( who is one of the greatest villains in any jackie chan movie .  )  you can expect some very funny scenes as jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girl friend ,  played by maggie chung .  his job is to protect ku's secretary who has enough information to take him down ,  but even that poses many problems .  jackie is at his absolute best here .  the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period .  it was the most intense fight i have ever seen jackie do and climaxes in a slide down a pole amidst exploding lights .  all in all ,  one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands .  he was fortunate he was not electrocuted as the person in charge of the stunt used high voltage instead of a lower voltage .   all in all ,  another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies .  by the end of this movie ,  you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen .  so many of his stuntmen were injured during this movie that nobody would insure them anymore - jackie had to take responsibility himself .  there are no gimmicks ,  wires or stand-ins - it is all true-life action that is a treat to watch .  it is this type of action that made him the phenomenon that he is and it is a movie that will amaze people 100 years from now .  if you have not seen this movie and are a fan of jackie chan or action in general ,  give yourself a treat and watch this movie .  it is truly sensational . 
1	the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie .  this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story .  the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks .   the story is about perception of the people who works ,  lives ,  and loves of our protagonist ,  and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth .  the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course ,  and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems .  the movie mostly took place in a small ,  out-dated radio station's studio with a very bad history ,  where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating .  it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid .  at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind .  what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did .  this movie is a very smart ,  abide rather short 76 minutes film . 
1	sweet romantic drama/comedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is .  naturally ,  they work together and can't stand each other .  you can guess the rest .  it's beautifully acted by the entire cast  ( especially sullavan ,  stewart and frank morgan )  ,  has a witty ,  intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning .  it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood ,  but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest !  everything looks so perfect and dream-like .  a one of a kind film .  don't miss it ! 
1	four words account for why this film was made -  " she done him wrong "  .  the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition .  here we are rewarded with a fast moving ,  well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars .   wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals ;  jackie cooper is a little harder to take ,  but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress .  with a strong director - as walsh proves himself to be - wray could carry a lot of punch ,  and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery's affection .   lots of atmosphere ,  beautifully designed ,  this is a forgotten film worthy of revival . 
1	the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv  ( ch .  5 )  during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s ,  mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve .  it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through ,  being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle .  the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer .  not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time .  definitely not a rankin-bass production . 
0	when stanwyck's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding ,  she retreats to a mountain lodge ,  where she slips  ( sort of )  off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan .  morgan falls in love with her ,  leading to a definitely one-sided marriage ,  spent on a huge estate in chicago  ( which appears to be surrounded by mountains !  )  .  stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez ,  but eventually returns to morgan ,  in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution .   this film has a great cast  ( morgan in particular is one of my favorites )  and a great director ,  but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times .  i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed .  still worth watching for the cast ,  and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films . 
1	 " panic in the streets "  is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as  " a streetcar named desire "  ,   " on the waterfront "  and  " east of eden "  .  kazan already won an oscar in 1947 ,  before this movie ,  so he was not a completely unknown at the time .  still  " panic in the streets "  is mostly a movie that passed under the radar .   the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script .  it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir elements .  the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility .   the cast is fairly unknown  ( especially at the time it was released )  but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles .  especially palance impresses as the tough gangster boss ,  with a very powerful looking face .   still the movie drags a little at some points .  the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from .   yet ,   " panic in the streets "  remains a perfectly watchable movie ,  mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch .  for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch .   8/10
1	men of honor stars cuba gooding jr .  ,  as real life navy diver carl brashear who defied a man's navy to become the first african american navy diver .  sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who carl brashear really admired .  his name was master chief billy sunday  ( robert deniro )  .  sunday in a lot of ways pushed ,  aggravated and helped carl become the man he wanted to be .    i loved cuba in this film .  his portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as denzel washington was in the hurricane .  through every scene we can see his passion ,  motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream .  we can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud .  i also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes .  brashear's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart-stopping and brilliant .    the only fault i could see would have to lie in the supporting cast .  cuba and deniro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch .  which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters .  the evil lt .  cmdr .  hanks ,  sunday's wife  ( charlize theron )  ,  the eccentric diving school colonel  ( hal holbrook )  and cuba's love interest are the characters i found to not have very much depth .  what could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them .  why was that colonel always in his tower ?  how come sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk ?   another curious question has to be this .  what happened to carl brashear's wedding ?  i mean if this film is chronicling this man's life wouldn't his wedding be an important event ?  maybe it's just me .  men of honor ,  however ,  is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops .  this film will inspire and make you feel for this man's struggle .  which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told .  my hat goes off to you carl brashear .  i really admire your strength .   
1	rod serling was ,  of course ,  a genius and his wonderful ,  playful ,  creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development .  there are no such shows now ,  but rather  " housewife "  sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher ,  or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens .   jack elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can't help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago week's show around elam ,  even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story .  this episode ends with a twist ,  as usual ,  but shock and humor are mixed with especially  " serlingesque "  dexterity .   rex lewis field
1	there's no way to confront 'zabriskie point' from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you'd use for other movies .  this is because it isn't a movie .  it's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film .  what we see are not the unfoldings of a plot ,  but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends .  we we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us- no one we know ,  but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere .  so what do we see ?  events .  we see people arguing ,  driving ,  and inevitably ,  escaping .  only the escape is from something intangible- it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness ,  or .  .  . human nature .  set in late 1960s los angeles ,  our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence .  these creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire .  although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible ,   ,  the characters are not themselves criminals .  they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar ,  non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday .  not that they are ever happy or sad ,  but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living .  they only achieve true life in the natural world ,  even though that is the next victim of modern existence .  at the end ,  'zabriski point' is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world .  as even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress ,  we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit . 
1	as i watched one of orson welles' last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker ,  i knew i was watching a great movie unfold ,  though at times i did not know why .  the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film-noir :  average-joe lead ,  femme fatale ,  conspicuous supporting characters ,  and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure .  it is an entertaining ride ,  and it's filled to the brim with welles' unique gifts as a director ,  but there are scenes that tend to just not work ,  or don't feel complete in what was welles' full vision  ( the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that )  .   welles co-stars with his then wife ,  the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth ,  as mike o'hara ,  an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people .  hayworth is mrs .  bannister ,  married to mr .  bannister  ( everett sloane ,  who played mr .  bernstein in citizen kane )  ,  who is accompanied by a friend mr .  grisby  ( glenn anders ,  who has great control in his eyes )  .  they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o'hara along for the ride ,  and at first he's reluctant ,  but agrees since he's falling for the married mrs .  as their journey unfolds ,  o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around ,  and more so with grisby ,  who at first seems out of his gourd .  yet as the plot unfolds ,  o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money ,  with results that i dare not reveal  ( although they have been discussed over and over by others )  .   whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story  ( and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated )  ,  the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty-five years .  though he doesn't have the terrific greg tolland  ( kane's dp )  at his side ,  dependable charles lawton jr .  assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark ,  covered in shadows ,  deep focus ,  low angles ,  the works .  a particular accomplishment is the fun-house mirror scene ,  which is merely a highlight among others .  welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent isn't anything special- and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush ,  despite her path in the story .    the lady from shanghai is worth checking out ,  especially for welles ,  hayworth ,  or film-noir buffs  ( fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well )  .  it may just take a little while ,  repeat viewings  ( as was for touch of evil )  ,  for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in . 
1	british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types :  the quiet ,  introspective ,  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire .  settings ,  characters ,  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories .  butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type .    the scripts are very verbal ,  including long interior monologues by the main character ria ,  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life .  when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  ( who makes his interest in her quite clear )  ,  she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered .   the acting and scripts are always on the money ,  which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one :  i was neither blown away by it nor turned off .  my mother ,  on the other hand ,  adored this show .  i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies . 
0	revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque  ( dean jagger )  trying to convince general duval  ( george cleveland )  that his mate tsiang  ( william crowell )  is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people & render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies  ( a bit like the people i work with really )  .  anyway ,  tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia  ( roy d'arcy )  but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies .  an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore .  general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire  ( dorothy stone )  who is engaged to louque who also comes along .  during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson  ( robert noland )  at which louque isn't too pleased about .  in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself & starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire & clifford .  .  .  co-written & directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation & after watching it i can see why .  the script by halperin ,  howard higgin & rollo lloyd all uncredited ,  has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull & as exciting as watching paint dry .  nothing much happens for ages & then nothing much happens afterwards either .  how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie ,  these zombies are just brainwashed people & filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a . romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead  ( 1968 )  .  at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long .  technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago ,  the black & white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location .  the acting is wooden & largely unimpressive .  revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well & in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through .  i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations & budget labels ,  but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for . 
0	the late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings .  renny harlin's superbly gritty and moody  " prison "  got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling ;  it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior  " the chair ,  "  john saxon's enjoyably trashy  " death house ,  "  the passable psycho picture  " destroyer ,  "  and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium .    your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp alex  ( the hugely unappealing nicholas celozzi )  go to alcatraz island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star sammy mitchell  ( blandly played by toni basil of  " hey micky "  fame )  .  alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic us civil war cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree ,  thus forcing wimpy alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter .   although slickly photographed by nicholas von sternberg ,  with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere  ( the film was shot on location in the dismal ,  rusty ,  rundown ruins of alcatraz island )  ,   " slaughterhouse rock "  nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid ,  effective fright feature .  this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters ,  a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing .  the flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more ,  with onetime  " playboy "  playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme hope marie carlton doing an especially irritating linnea quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo .  dimitri logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style ,  but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy ,  horrendously sophomoric silliness ,  and ,  most damagingly ,  ted landon's sloppy ,  inconsistent ,  overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible .  in other words ,  this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail sentence . 
1	i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's .  the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time .  the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe  ( or hoof )  with eerie protective suits .  the experienced british soldiers don gas masks  ( only )  and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers .  the gas clouds move ever closer ,  finally enveloping the british defenders .  the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb .  suddenly a scream from the defenders .  .  .  this gas is like no other that they have experienced before .  .  .  .    now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver ,  i think that you will too ! 
0	does this film suck !  !  horrible acting ,  horrible script ,  horrible effects ,  horrible horrible horrible !  !  nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans !  a crazy killer stalks students at a college .  people are showing up dead in the hallways ,  but still ,  class carries on as normal ?  ?  ?  after about the 4th body ,  i would think that they could allow the students a few days break !  lol .  this about as bad as it gets folks .  this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals .  you have been warned ! 
0	there is a key aspect of film that jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you .  you don't need to tell the audience what to think ,  because they'll see it .  the action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former .  and it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals .  maybe jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support .  and he may have been right ,  it lacks a basic credibility :  70s edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the velvet underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath .  from the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together ,  it's all too contrived for my taste . 
0	 .  .  .  bad at being intentionally bad .  .  .   this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen .  while it's obvious the movie isn't trying to be taken seriously  ( hopefully that their goal ,  anyway .  .  .  )  ,  the movie is still plain bad .  hell ,  it makes leprechaun in space look big budgeted .  .  .   in short :  paint my muscle car prune colored ! 
0	don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out ,  and no matter how good  ( or bad )  it is people love it .   i saw this movie with my two kids  ( 5 , 7 )  .  they like pretty much anything animated  ( like most people who rated this film )  .  the theater was almost full ,  and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast .  to tell the truth i was bored silly .  it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny .  there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it .  of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh ,  but just didn't work .  my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie ,  but not on this one .  my daughter fell asleep half way through .  also ,  the kids thought the character animation looked weird .  i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express ,  which gave my daughter nightmares .   trust me ,  i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything .  but quality is quality ,  and like so many animated movies they throw out there ,  it has very little . 
1	dig !  is funny ,  fun ,  amusing ,  interesting ,  stylish ,  and very well done .  knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told ,  especially with such style and substance .  if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see .   focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs ,  alcohol ,  and insanity .  if i did not know that this is footage of real people ,  i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece .  the story is compelling ,  concise ,  and simply amazing . 
0	probably the worst bollywood film i've seen .   no plot line .  very little character developments .   full of silly and pointless humor .  the whole film was chaotic and direction-less .  there was no proper ending to the story .  the airport was filmed in a shopping mall .    same story chewed over and over again until you want to say  " please ,  just move on with it !  !  "  even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed .   the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around .  .  .  but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days .   btw i'm not from an indian background  2/10
1	james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle .  stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy .  the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting .   we meet a selection of gamblers ,  gun fighters ,  indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles ,  bank heists etc .  the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live-wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger .  also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief .   the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop .  throw in some good old western action ,  fist fights ,  shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure .  8/10
1	with films like  " wallace & gromit "  and  " chicken run "  under their belt ,  the good people from the other side of the pond ,  aardman animation ,  are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of  " creature comforts "  .   derived from a short done early in their careers ,   " creature comforts "  is a slice-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort .   aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as ,   " are you a liar ?  "  and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives .   the answers ,  while seeming to be boring and mundane ,  are actually quite funny ,  when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later .   how many of these animals look like the person making the statements ?  one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman ,   " i like them kind of thin .  "  is an insect ,  the walking stick .   there are two dogs discussing odors and smells ,  while sniffing the behind of a poodle ,  as they talk about the different smells of a woman .   there are two birds in a cage .  as the  " wife "  tells the litany that is her health ,  her long suffering husband stands by her ,  saying nothing .   while it might take some time for  " creature comforts "  to find it's  " legs "  ,  it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary .  while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills ,   " creature comforts "  is one of a kind and definitely worth watching .   some of the humor might seem a little racy ,  it's the claymation that catches the attention of the children  ( like the old batman series of the 60's ,  the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them )  and it's the jokes that are there for the adults . 
0	i thought this was a sequel of some sorts ,  and it is meant to be to the original from 1983 .  but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it .   i actually had very little expectations to this movie ,  but i just wasted 95 minutes of life .  no suspense - i actually feel clairvoyant ,  poor acting ,  and so filled with technical errors ,  so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it .  they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours .  but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie .   do not see this movie ,  this is a complete waste of time .  instead get the original .  the theme is still valid .  don't let to much power into a machine .  and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling . 
1	don't read anything about this movie  ( especially nothing that could contain any spoilers )  .  just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience .  if you like to see an intelligent ,  twisted story :  go ,  get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed .   " cypher "  is not really a sci-fi movie ,  more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business .  it's about corporate secrets ,  how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them .  the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness .  cypher is much deeper ,  more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much ,  much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies  " cube "  and  " nothing "  .  actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen  ( and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick )  .  sorry ,  can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience .  just give it a chance .   ; - ) 
1	coming of age movies are quite usual these days .  for 1980 ,   " foxes "  really gives its meaning .  jodie foster plays her character straight out .  ever since she did  " taxi driver "  four years earlier ,  she has a stronger character in this movie .  she's jeanie ,  a high schooler who has plenty of guts ,  and seems to get out of any situation she's in .  scott baio plays brad way before chachi on  " happy days "  .  he's deemed immature by the other girls .  cherie currie is annie ,  hangs with the wrong crowd ,  chased by her policeman father .  jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand .  exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous .  annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted .  reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident .  and one gets married to a much older man .  growing up isn't easy ,  sometimes we got to explore life how it is .  in reality ,  you got to be careful about the people surrounding you .  for me ,  i was my own person ,  and i tend to stay that way !  great music ,  great plot ,  this movie's a gem !  4 out of 5 stars ! 
0	i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was .  .  .  but the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody ,  it felt more like an insult to the viewer's intelligence .  the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people .  .  . 
1	look ,  this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world .  to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself .  i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty .  the economy was weak ,  communism threatened us all ,  and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty .  out of that confusion came a hero ,  stroker ace .  ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness .  his triumph is an inspiration to all .  the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer .  jim nabors is a poet .  go see this movie tonight ! 
0	the husband-and-wife team of bennie fields and blossom seeley were huge stars in vaudeville ,  yet they made very few films .  as is the case for some other performers of their era  ( george m .  cohan ,  fanny brice ,  gertrude lawrence )  the most accessible piece of film footage for fields and seeley is the biopic about them ,  in which they're portrayed by other actors :  'somebody loves me' ,  starring betty hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man ralph meeker .   in their heyday ,  fields and seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- jesse block and eve sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act ,  effectively becoming the  " second-team "  fields and seeley .  offstage ,  though ,  there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements .  fields and seeley lived in hotel suites ,  paying room-service rates for every meal they ate ,  and eventually running out of money .  block and sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely ,  ending in comfortable retirement .   the first 30 seconds of this vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists .  apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 ,  although i've never heard of them .  finally ,  fields and seely rush in and start performing .  they both have plenty of pep ,  and she's fairly attractive .   i was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance ,  but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short .  when they finally start hoofing ,  the results are not impressive .   i was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act .  now that i've seen it ,  i understand why they never became stars in movie musicals .  my rating for this one :  just 4 out of 10 ,  and i'll stick with block and sully . 
0	i couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons :  robin williams and toni collete .  the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on .  robin williams plays gabriel noon ,  a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues :  his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block .  one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named pete boland  ( rory culkin )  .  pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents .  he lives with his adopted mother and social worker ,  donna boland  ( toni collette )  .  gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete ,  but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist .  i won't go into detail because i don't want to spoil the film ,  but i will tell you this :  it is quite predictable .  fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette ,  who i thought was the film's key character .  collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses .  her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar  ( hell ,  i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better )  .  the film starts off as a psychological thriller ,  but a predictable one at that .  if your curious to know the film's ending and twists ,  then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called  " hide and seek "  . 
1	in a word - excellent .  this is the movie .  go and see it .  the director ron howard .  .  .  i mean ,  the director ron howard did a fantastic job ,  as he usually does .  an incredible attention to detail ,  vivid colors and decorations ,  breathtaking whoville atmosphere ,  astonishing variety of costumes .  wait ,  there's more to it than that - the story is very good ,  too .  there's clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers .  jim carrey is top-notch .  he is probably the best grinch possible .  the girl ,  taylor momsen ,  is real good .  i'm sure she has some great future .  the dog is cool .  all in all ,  it's a very high quality christmas fairy-tale .  if you like fairy-tales ,  it's for you .  if you like christmas ,  it's for you .   reading some other reviews here .  .  .  get a life .  it hurts me every time to see people out there who .  .  .  well .  .  .  got their hearts two sizes too small . 
0	to anyone not familiar with c . s .  forrester's book this film should be interesting .  it is colorful ,  well acted and depicts high adventure ,  but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling .  i could hardly sit through it .   for some reason screen-writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on .  of course ,  the spoken word is different from the written word ,  and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film .  but ,  why do the screen-writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it ?  in this case the writers out-did themselves .   just a few examples :  there was no mutiny on the renown .  the officers did take over the ship after the half-insane captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway -for reasons implied but never given .  there was no court martial .  the court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere .  captain pellew does not appear appear in this part of the hornblower saga ,  nor does col .  ortega's wife .  hornblower ,  himself ,  was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore .  there are plenty of such manipulations of forrester's story .   on a purely technical basis ,  i think the film's repeated use of the flash-back device hurts the continuity of the story .   why ,  oh why did screen-writers have to mess up a good story ? 
1	this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot .  however ,  this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series .  on the contrary .  sure ,  it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times ,  but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission .   the first third of the movie ,  where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt ,  is a classic .  jabba ,  a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language ,  not only makes a great villain ,  but a memorable one ,  too .  it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet ,  much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product .  actually ,  what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court ,  including the intimidating ,  slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster .  it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while .   things get a little bit slower around the second act ,  where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor ,  home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks .  most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures ,  in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga .  i don't totally agree with that ,  although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should .  however ,  their leader ,  wicket  ( played by warrick davis )  is a delightfully memorable creation ,  and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple ,  natural weapons provides a nice contrast .   by the time we get to the third act ,  though ,  the pace picks up again ,  as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops ,  lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star ,  and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor .  the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie .  mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes ,  and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance .  also ,  as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is ,  he is rivaled only by the shriveled ,  crone-like emperor ,  played with deliciously raspy ,  frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid .  the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment ,  which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored .   the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects ,  and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors .  the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always ,  and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout .  of course ,  given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back ,  it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence .  the acting is classic star wars fare ;  hamill ,  harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles ,  and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po .  frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes ,  but he makes the most of it .  and yes ,  there's also john williams' music .   all told ,  while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle ,  the first and third acts deliver in style ,  making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever .   in 1997 ,  george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored  ( and revamped )   " special editions "  ,  which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements .  of the three ,  return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans .  perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place  ( albeit funny if you're not so easily offended )   " jedi rocks "  musical number in jabba's palace ,  which ,  although technically amazing ,  does disrupt the flow of the film .  however ,  i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy .  this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes  ( notably on naboo ,  where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming ,   " wesa free !  "  )  ,  and ,  in what is probably the most controversial change ,  hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes .  probably due to the intense  ( and unfair )  disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii :  attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone .  however ,  if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically  ( and contemplating about it )  ,  chances are you may react a little differently .  nonetheless ,  it is an issue that fans have raised ,  so it's probably best to be warned beforehand .   as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films ,  he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the  " definitive "  editions of his classic trilogy ,  and ,  when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga  ( as lucas intended )  ,  it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent .  the original films will always be engraved in our memories ,  but these new incarnations are just as much fun ,  if one can give them a chance . 
0	note :  i will reveal a key part of the plot ,  but if you've looked at the dvd cover or any promotional material ,  you'll already know it .   this movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it .  the writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an organism .   forget the fact the the un and the nsa seem to be running the show in hungary .  forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear  ( not even gloves )  .  these are quibbles in the context of this movie .  in the scientific world within this story ,  2+2=6 . 34 and gravity goes sideways .   the fact is that the people in this movie do not  ( with a few exceptions )  behave the way human beings behave .  almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate .  the love story  ( of course there is one )  makes soap opera scripts seem like shakespeare .   i can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing . 
0	why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film ?  has he really been that strapped for cash ?   the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about ,  grief ?  ,  exotic places ?  ,  ghosts ?  ,  a vehicle for mr darcy ?  it's a muddled ,  muddy mess .   there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good ,  in itself ,  and that italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland .   there are pointless episodes on the beach ,  in churches ,  on busy roads - but what it is all about ,  or why anybody should care simply isn't clear .   there was also a yank woman in the film .  it wasn't clear what here job was ,  but she seemed only to be there to make vapid ,  inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl .  was it supposed to be about paedophillia ?  ?   a pretty dreadful mess ,  all in all .  i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film . 
1	this is how movies are supposed to be made :  a fascinating setting ;  characters about whom you come to care deeply ;  writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense .  this is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental .  highly recommended . 
0	this movie is about tyrannus ,  a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus ,  a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead .  tyrannus ,  we learn after about an hour ,  is also called demonicus .  this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity ,  psychology and ourselves .    the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list  ( killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin )  by possessing the body of a college guy .  he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this ,  which the college boy willingly puts on his head ,  and then at several points in the movie ,  takes off and puts back on .   maria performs oral sex on a poor man's sean willian scott ,  and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove .  tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason ,  and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this .  utter misfortune .   this movie is empty and will hurt you .  see it . 
0	years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him ,  he's also married to the blonde reporter  ( stacie foster )  who led the rebellion in the first film ,  now a new conspiracy is in the works ,  one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes ,  and a corporation looking to rule the world  ( there is no plot to back any of this up )  and cyber tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie .  i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by pm ,  pm was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks  ( like this )  which had tons of explosions ,  little story and overall nothing but mean edged action .  some of these titles have been  ( mildly )  enjoyable  ( last man standing and the sweeper )  however cyber tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less don wilson .  when comparing the protagonists of similar pm efforts both jeff wincott and c .  thomas howell are oscar nominees when compared to don wilson .  another telling sign is that this was directed by richard pepin who has none of the flair joseph merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets .  then again though both c .  thomas and wincott are probably more expensive to obtain .  cyber tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol r ,  there are so many steals from better movies  ( robocop ,  terminator ,  universal soldier to even halloween iii !  )  that it's almost as if richard pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action ,  cyber tracker 2 falls flat .  there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact .  the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material .  also stacie foster looks like she could be better with far better material .  however cyber tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy ,  bland and lackluster as its leading man ,  however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on ,  all there is ,  is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here .   *1/2 out of 4- ( poor ) 
0	ok .  .  .  .  .  this is the third in the series of carnosaur .  lets star with the dinosaur puppets !  in the start of the film you cant see the dino's cause when the body count starts you can only see the dino's eye vision ,  pretty smart to hide the bad puppets !  and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance ,  the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body's after the dino rampage ,  after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream ,  pretty creepy !  !  !  and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found !  it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet !  ?  wtf !  the story is simple .  1 .  some terrorist's attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there .  2 .  they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-rex in there !  how did the t-rex fit in there ?  ?  ?  3 .  rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs !  sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive= (  4 .  holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats !  5 .  the dino's is now on a boat in the pacific .  6 :  strange i didn't know that the t-rex had a strange thing on hes neck ?  ?  ?  7 .  the end .  the film is good if you want a good laugh .  5/10
1	nicely done ,  and along with  " new voyages "  it's a great continuation !  fab to see james cawley in the latest episode  " vigil "  check it out !    i like the growing characterisation ,  and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan-produced piece .  this show manages to capture the feel quite well ,  as they state on the ste ,  it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience ,  a strong script editor ,  and a pick-up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is !   good work to all concerned !    ( i have a huge soft spot for lefler & mcfarland  ( great acting )  ,  although i'm a bit tired of  " lefler's laws "  .  enough already !  shelby's great  ( if a little uptight )  and it's cool she got the ship .  commodore ian's nice  ( like fred flintstone )  ,  but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself .  the doc ,  counselor ,  and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes ,  as is the wonderful nechayev  ( what a beautiful accent - a real russian !   ( well ,  i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep .  )   it gets my vote ,  and the cgi is kewl .  some of the greenscreen's obvious ,  but on a small budget whaddayagonndo ?   really glad i found it !    ( ok ,  some of the acting isn't great but it's fan-made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry cmm .  cole )   the gay material is layed on too thick  ( graham norton'd be embarrassed )  .  trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging ?  it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent - i hope they tone it down & let aster & zen be people not tokens - i don't treat my gay friends any differently ,  they're just regular guys .   musically it's a mixed bag .  i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time ,  but timing can fall flat now & then  ( the end of  " worst fears part 2 "  misses the crunch ,  and the edit .  love the fact they use the  " galaxy quest "  music !   i certainly can't wait for more !  !  dazza   " never give up ,  never surender !

1	the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival ,  i thought it intriguing ,  fascinating ,  the sensitive bi-sexual artist .  so very european ,  so very dutch !  i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex .  get a grip !  this guy is a freeloader ,  living off of society .  i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the  " spiderwoman "  is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars  ( and bed )  with strangers !  not only is he making outrageous sums of  ( probably taxfree )  loot for making up stories  ( lying guilt trip )  but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut ,  hence he hustles the beauty salon owner .  then he has the nerve to complain about the bill !  but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made .  on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films .  hmmm ,  maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all ? 
0	with its companion piece masters of horror ,  nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limits .   of course ,  part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience ,  instead aiming at ten-year-olds ,  who are only able to count body-bags ,  and scarcely that .  and so grossness is king ,  and king is grossness .   stephen king is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson .  since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies .   true ,  the cinema is not such a bad place to start ,  since it has generally escaped the onslaught of  " realism "  .  but these films are only the rumor ,  not the thing ,  and if you want to write ,  you have to dig deeper .   of course ,  only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances .  but even so ,  it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosi .   at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong .  one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary .   not ,  mind you ,  trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part ,  making the stupid stupider ,  but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew .  suppose ,  you were paralyzed ,  and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things !  wouldn't that be gross ?  and that ,  boys and girls ,  is the story .   what about characterization ?  oh yes ,  he's one of these suits ,  who never really appreciated life ,  you know ,  and now it's too late ,  right ?  and he's shouting  well ,  they can't actually hear him ,  you know  he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital ,  but he's not such a big shot anymore ,  you see ,  lying there  ( or is it laying ,  i can never remember )  and all .  and he's thinking :  oh no please ,  please don't cut me and this is terrible ,  lying  ( or laying )  like that  now ,  wouldn't that be a great story ?  you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that ,  i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie .  what was the name of that snake again ,  oh yeah ,  a boomslang  has quite a ring to it ,  doesn't it .   let's make it a peruvian boomslang !  sure ,  steve ,  that's great  except that boomslang is afrikaans ,  you moron !  but how can you really tell that the target audience is children ,  and not simply mental defects ?  it's easy :  there's no sex .   well ,  there is ,  but it's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent's bedroom .  modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre ,  the monster ,  the female victim ,  the chase .   but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea what's going on .  all that's really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil .   in spite of a certain discrepancy in size ,  king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray .  freddy krueger can only kill her .   and since there's no real titillation in that ,  he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her ,  you understand ,  since that would upset our puritan sentiments .  and so ,  horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths .   our hero ,  you see ,  is a rubber fetishist ,  and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves  ( giggle )  .  and that's what they use in autopsies ,  and that's how they discover that he is ,  in fact ,  you know .   obviously ,  this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers .  too bad ,  they cut it out ,  since it might have upset the five-year-olds watching the show ! 
0	holy cow ,  what a piece of sh*t this movie is .  i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie .  i guess they didn't know either !  i don't remember any farting or belching in the book ,  do you ?   they took this all times childrens classic ,  added some farting ,  belching and sexual inuindo ,  and prostituted it into a kaka joke .  this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like .  i have to say ,  visually it was interesting ,  but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor  ( if you even think that kind of thing is funny )  i don't want the kids that i know to think it is .   don't take your kids to see ,  don't rent the dvd .  i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie . 
1	yet again ,  madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side .  and a remarkable one it is ,  literally and figuratively .   mumbai hi-society -- stars and starlets ,  glam dolls and witch doctors ,  business tycoons and broker types ,  yep the whole stinking lot -- are in sharp focus here .  in typical tabloid fashion ,  their worlds unfold ,  with every colorful story a clever sub-plot in itself .   a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant ,  the stewardess and her high-profile husband ,  the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife ,  the reporters and the police captain ;  all shades on display and countless hues in between .   bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings ,  the dancing queens and the living dead .  atul kulkarni packs a punch ,  as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul .  konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex-crime beat reporter ,  but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit .   highly focused  ( running time 140 min )  and refreshingly different film ,  well worth the money . 
1	wow !  the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances .  absolutely incredible !  if this was visconti's debut film ,  i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film .  the only other one of his i've seen  ( at time of writing )  is death in venice - which was absolutely incredible :  more dazzling visually than ossessione  ( obsession )  .  one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen ,  but its story was not as involving as ossessione .  if you click on  " miscellaneous "  on this page's links ,  there are stills from the movie on those websites .  they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie :  such graceful camera movements ,  such beautiful composition ,  such wonderful faces ,  such terrific characters ,  such a great story development ,  the first movie adapted from james m cain's  " the postman always rings twice .  "   i can't believe this was made in 43 ,  eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire  ( 1951 )  .  the actors in this may not have used the method technique ,  ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves  ( i don't know anything about it )  - but they're some of the best ,  most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema .  also ,  eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ,  ossessione was electrifyingly sensual !  the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema !  yes ,  i'm being superlative ,  but ossessione was just that terrific .   the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini ,  and re-cut in america .  american audiences didn't see its full glory till 59 ,  eight years after streetcar .   i won't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best ,  most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen ,  and tell you to go out and see it !  like another reviewer ,  i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it ! 
0	really ,  everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else !  no wonder ,  the casting is done not with the left hand ,  but rather not at all .  i haven't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent ,  carrying a gun .  you don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role .  the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute .  the rest of the cast is likewise awful ,  possibly with hurt as the sole exception ,  sometimes you can see him trying ,  but suffering .  oh ,  did i mention that it is a completely insane story ?  jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family ?  well ,  it must be because the guy  ( weller )  is german ?   2/10 ,  because the photography could be worse . 
0	in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and  " king arthur "  ,  on dvds chosen by others for an evening's  " entertainment "  and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination ,  and is content as long as they get  " action "  .  both movies were utter rubbish .   whatever happened to character development ?  whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ?  whatever happened to acting ?  and ,  when watching something that vaguely purports to be  " historical "  ,  whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy ,  some realistic idea of the  " political map "  of the time ,  even some slight flavour of the era ,  especially in its social attitudes .  why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america ?  i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that  " little was known "  of the dark ages .  not so .  considerable amounts are known ,  with much learned scholarship on the era ,  but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework .   i only wish i could vote 0/10
0	i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures' latest release ,  'the return' .  i myself ,  along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film .  on the contrary though ,  its actually a supernatural thriller .  too bad it is not the least bit thrilling .   'the return' stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills ,  a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven .  it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met .  while in texas on a business trip ,  she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown ,  la salle .  there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions .  a man by the name of terry stahl ,  who is played by peter o'brien .  joanna is now on a desperate search for answers .  a search that could in the end result in her very own murder .   i really don't know where to begin here folks .  which should i mention first ?  the atrocious acting ,  hideous directing ,  or the terribly bland story ?  no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same :  they simply suck .  adam sussman's screenplay is downright moronic .  its not interesting .  its not compelling .  its just plain unpleasant .  i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the  " film "   ( i've placed quotations around film because i don't believe 'the return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it's foulness .  )  and at least give it some slight chance of hope ,  but nothing ever happened .  i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze .  not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster .  of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the  " film "  .  i assume this is why the acting was so awful .  at least that's what i'm choosing to believe .  i really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances .  they need immediate medical attention if they do .   now the directing was unmistakably bad ,  but i can't quite crucify asif kapadia entirely .   ( well i could ,  but i won't since i'm such a nice guy .  )  i look at 'the return' as a test for kapadia because for all of you that don't know ,  this is his first full-length feature  " film "  .  he's just getting his foot in the door and still learning .  next time around ,  well if there is a next time ,  hopefully he will have improved vastly .  the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispel's 2003 re-make of 'the texas chainsaw massacre' .  now that's nice the  " film "  was given that ,  but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that .  copying someone else's work isn't something i consider to be praise worthy .   ( even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed .  )   i think jim sonzero's american re-make of 'pulse' will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to 'the return' .  it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way .  now i don't doubt this will make a small ,  and i mean very small ,  profit .  no matter what though ,  it won't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellar's previous acting effort ,  'the grudge' .  on that note ,  there's one last thing i'd like to add .  i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'the return' .  that is something i never wish to experience again ,  along with the  " film "  itself . 
1	 " moonstruck "  is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it .  i really liked it the second time .  i loved it the third time .  now it is one of my all time favorites .   the humor is subtle but really good .  the film offers a lot of warmth humor .  the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc .  cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch .  this film is ,  by far ,  the best job nicholas cage has done on film .  the old man character is fantastic .  he lights up the screen without saying a word .  the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic .  but ,  perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis .   the film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen .  exceptional direction and wrap up . 
0	i really liked zb1 .  really ,  i did .  i have no problem with extremely low-budget movies ,  and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3  ( if you can imagine such a thing .  check out 'wiseguys vs .  zombies , ' if you're interested )  .  indeed ,  i prefer lower budget zombie films ,  because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are 'about . '  but zb3 was just so bad .  it was retarded .  i don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism .  i want my 90 minutes back ,  etc .  except that it really only took ~80 minutes ,  because partway through i put it into 1 . 4x fast forward .   okay ,  here's some criticism .   1 .  the pacing was terrible .  everyone talked in monologues .  even when someone just had a single line ,  the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f-bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue .  at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1's 70 minutes ,  but there were actually fewer 'events' in zb3 .  it's all talking .   2 .  the gore effects got stupider .  just glop rubbed around on people's tummies .   3 .  despite the epic exposition ,  there really wasn't a plot .  and the exposition is indeed epic !  i won't spoil it ,  if you're going to watch it .   ( don't watch it .  )  but then ,  it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~80 minutes .  or fewer ,  if you so choose . 
0	remakes  ( and sequels )  have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the media .  it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though .  if you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards ,  you can have a success .  note ,  such films like the thief of bagdad  ( 1924/1940 )  or king kong  ( 1933/2005 )  succeeded in their attempts .  others like king kong  ( 1976 )  fail ,  miserably .   brief encounter  ( 1945 )  is the template for this film .  it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb**********ten .  the story is simple ,  love ,  innocently found by accident and tragically lost .  why ,  it just happened for the two  ( 2 )  principals involved at the wrong time .  these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson .  neither are conventionally leading star material ,  but quality character actors .  for the details watch the film .   now what went wrong ?  a t . v .  movie ,  remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb******six .  both actors though appear disinterested ,  just showing up to punch their time-clocks and pick up their checks .  neither are involved with their characters or with each other .  you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them .  that should not be and that's why it fails in its intent .  sometimes it is just better to leave things alone . 
1	when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant !  however ,  on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making .  this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history .   the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment .   sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal ,  revenge and the importance of companionship .  this movie is any director's dream at its very core .   however ,  sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking .  the writing ,  provided by scribe tim sheridan ,  was just as breathtaking .   the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen .  specifically speaking ,  the final scene  ( warning :  spoilers !  !  !  spoilers !  !  !  )  where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time ,  is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen .  sheridan is the next robert towne .   in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat .   therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer .  never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail .  a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easy .   all in all this film combines creative writing ,  stunning production and masterful direction .  this is the art of film at its best .  when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more .   the romeo division is groundbreaking ,  a masterpiece and ,  most importantly ,  the romeo division is indeed art . 
0	don't get me wrong ,  i'm a huge fan of many of woody's movies ,  obviously his late 70's masterpieces  ( annie hall , interiors ,  manhattan ) and most of his late 80's/early 90's dramas  ( hannah ,  crimes and misdemeaners , husbands and wives )  in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts  ( melinda ,  anything else ,  small time crooks )  but this was abysmal ,  i though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was .   it was lazily plotted - basically a cross between match point ,  manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks , with all the jokes taken out - woody seems to be on the way out as well ,  slurring most of his lines and delivering 'hilarious' catchphrases 'i mean that with all due respect .  .  . ' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare .   i know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this - and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future ,  if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it .   it wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort ,  woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke .   embarrassingly bad
1	i've seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago .  .  i must admit ,  it was a really good western which features 2 of the big names .  .  on one side ,  there's charlton heston ,  playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade .  on the other .  .  the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo .  .  seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the cost .  .  !   the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters .  .  most of the actors played it out really well .  .  especially james coburn ,  who i find that he was really mean in this film .  .  but that how it was .  .   christopher mitchum ,  who i've seen everywhere in other films .  .  playing hal brickman .  .  i felt his character was left out in the cold ,  but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade ,  to bring down provo's posse's !   all in all ,  it was a great film .  .  very good to watch .  .  great score from the late jerry goldsmith .  .   wonderful piece of western persona .  .  !  8 out of 10 . 
1	karloff and lugosi - together again !  this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much .  it's not an all-out horror film like the duo's previous two hits ,  the black cat and the raven .  but ,  it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re-visited .   the invisible ray was directed by lambert hillyer ,  a director who mainly made westerns ,  but curiously in these final days of the laemmles' reign at universal ,  he found himself helming this and the laemmles' final horror film ,  dracula's daughter .  both are crisp ,  clean-cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements .   just as lugosi went wild in the raven ,  much needs to be said of karloff's hamming in the invisible ray .  the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that karloff's character ,  rukh ,  acts so madly before he is poisoned by radium x ,  that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing .  this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining - he's basically a loony right from the start .  there isn't any real transformation .  same here .  halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind .  i still enjoyed his performance ,  though ,  just as i did lugosi's over-the-top antics in the raven .   meanwhile ,  lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained ,  and thoughtful turn as rukh's rival in science ,  dr .  benet .  lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film ,  including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh ,  of which i am in alignment with horror film writer john soister on -  " and if he  ( rukh )  touches anyone ?  "  the inspector inquires .  lugosi hesitatingly replies ,  in a way that only lugosi could deliver ,   " they die "  .  just as lugosi could be so off ,  he could also be more perfect than any actor .  this is one of those moments .   therefore ,  karloff and lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff pared off against the cool logic of lugosi .  karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times ,  however ,  one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one .  he only had one more chance  ( ninotchka )  .   the invisible ray is a fun film ,  and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans .  it is one of those films that improves on each viewing ,  not because it is a masterpiece ,  but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker ,  more horrific pairings they had .  the special effects ,  by the always innovative john fulton ,  are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate .  frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman ,  something seldom seen in classic horror films .  the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film .  a terrific ,  fun film ! 
1	bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant .  expertly scripted and perfectly delivered ,  this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter .  it's vulgar ,  provocative ,  witty and sharp .  the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society  ( or to be more accurate ,  of any society )  .  following the escapades of keisha ,  latrina and natella ,  our three  " protagonists "  for want of a better term ,  the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject .  political correctness flies out the window in every episode .  if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable ,  then bromwell high will not disappoint ! 
1	the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series .  however ,  spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced .  i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit  ( sorry )  of the comic with a modern twist .  i'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series .  sam  ( flash gordon )  jones was a perfect spirit .  nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek : deep space nine years later .  maybe with the release of frank miller's big-screen version of the spirit ,  more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history .  it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea ,  someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars .  when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro ,  we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd ,  such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s  ( although all copies i ever saw were badly edited )  .  heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon . 
1	when a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague  ( a variant of bubonic plague )  ,  u . s .  public health service official dr .  clinton reed  ( richard widmark )  immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body .  unfortunately ,  the stiff got that way by being murdered ,  and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague ,  leading to an epidemic .  enter police captain tom warren  ( paul douglas )  ,  who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster .   while panic in the streets is a quality film ,  it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling  ( my reason for bringing the score down to an eight )  .  it wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster ,  police procedural ,  thriller and even romance .   this is not director elia kazan's best work ,  but saying that is a bit disingenuous .  kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as a streetcar named desire  ( 1951 )  ,  on the waterfront  ( 1954 )  and east of eden  ( 1955 )  ,  after all .  this film predates those ,  but kazan has said that he was already  " untethered "  by the studio .  taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl .  the film is set in new orleans ,  a city where kazan  " used to wander around  .   .   .  night and day so i knew it well "  .  he wanted to exploit the environment .   " it's so terrific and colorful .  i wanted boats ,  steam engines ,  warehouses ,  jazz joints--all of new orleans "  .   kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well ,  but they could be connected better .  the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods .  the sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked .  part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers edna and edward anhalt ,   " quarantine "  and  " some like 'em cold "  .   the gangster material ,  which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film ,  is probably the highlight .  not surprisingly ,  kazan has said that he believes the villains are  " more colorful--i never had much affection for the good guys anyway .  i don't like puritans "  .  a close second is the only material that approaches the  " panic "  of the title--the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed ,  inoculate them and contain the disease .  while there is plenty of suspense during these two  " moods "  ,  much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama ,  with pacing more typical of that genre .   the dialogue throughout is excellent .  the stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced .  it is intelligent ,  delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character .  conflict isn't created by  " dumb "  decisions but smart moves ;  events and characters' actions are more like a chess game .  when unusual stances are taken ,  such as reed withholding the plague from the newspapers ,  he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions ,  which other characters argue over .   in light of this ,  it's interesting that kazan believed that  " propriety ,  religion ,  ethics and the middle class are all murdering us "  .  that idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm ,  or allowances away from it ,  made by the protagonists .  for example ,  head gangster blackie  ( jack palance in his first film role )  is offered a  " get out of jail free "  card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague .   the technical aspects of the film are fine ,  if nothing exceptional ,  but the real reasons to watch are the performances ,  the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue . 
1	to some ,  this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation .  .  .  others see it as a story of grace ,  restoration ,  and hope .  .  .  it is actually both  henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion ,  his downward spiral of sin ,  and his upward climb of healing .  .   'david and bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity .  .  .  henry king handles the powerful story ,  taken from the old testament ,  with skill .  .  .   david ,  'the lion of judah , ' having stormed the walls of rabgah ,  saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah  ( kieron moore )  ,  and returns to jerusalem .  .  .    back at his court ,  his first wife complains of neglect ,  and offends him for being a shepherd's son ,  distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul .  .  .   one evening ,  and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood ,  david's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath .  .  .  she was beautiful and attractive .  .  .  david could not take his eyes off her .  .  .  he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers .  .  .    sending for her ,  he discovers that she ,  too ,  is unhappy in her marriage .  .  .  by this point ,  it's apparent that david's intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife ,  to just plain taking bathsheba .  .  .  as usual ,  sin had its consequences ,  and david hadn't planned on that possibility .  .  .   when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine ,  david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin .  .  .  but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses ,  david tries to cover up his sin .  .  .    he sends word to joab ,  the commander of his army ,  and ordered him to send to him bathsheba's husband .  .  .  david did something that was abominable in god's sight .  .  .  he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed .  .  .    the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way ,  david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor .  .  .   god punishes the couple when bathsheba's child dies soon after birth .  .  .  meanwhile ,  a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites - led by nathan - blame the king for their plight .  .  .  they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin .  .  .   peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity .  .    hayward as bathsheba ,  is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery .  .  .  the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history ,  is badly mishandled ,  and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward's face and shoulders .  .  .   raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet ,  sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba ;  gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david's personality and kingship ;  ex-silent screen idol ,  francis x .  bushman ,  had a brief part as king saul .  .  .    the best moments of the film were :  the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object ;  the defining moment in david's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death ;  and for the film's climax ,  inserting it as a flashback ,  david remembering his fight with the giant goliath .  .  .    with superb color photography and a masterly music score ,  'david and bathsheba' won oscar nominations in the following categories :  music scoring ,  art and set direction ,  cinematography ,  story and screenplay ,  and costume design .  . 
1	second part  ( actually episode 4-8 )  of the hit danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one ,  but has plenty of laughs and scares as well .  this time ,  udo kier plays two parts ,  as the monster baby and his demon-like father .  other standout parts this time are søren pilmark´s doctor krogshoj ,  who must face the horrible revenge of dr .  helmer ,  and once again ,  patient mrs .  drusse tries to solve the mysteries ,  miss marple-style .  ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård  ( dr .  helmer )  and kirsten rolffes  ( mrs .  drusse )  ,  you wonder how they´re ever going to be able making part iii ,  but i hope von trier will give it a shot .  sadly ,  morten rotne leffers ,  the down´s syndrome dishwasher #2 ,  died shortly after ,  as well .  look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo .  ***
1	arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter .   he drinks quite a lot too ,  and sometimes he is driving while drinking ,  too ,  which of course is not funny ,  ever .    the movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality ,  too .  john gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages .  talk about deserving an oscar .  moore and minnelli have their moments ,  but its gielgud as  " hobson "  you'll remember the most . 
1	not sure if it was right or wrong ,  but i read thru the other comments before watching the short . i have to say i disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it .   as a first time  " lone wolf "  director/producer , i like to see things that i can aspire to , not necessarily from the pro's ,  but by people just getting their feet wet like me .   if indeed this is also from a first-timer , as i read , i applaud the effort . marvelous job then in that respect !  there were some comments about the music . i thought it was quite nice for the piece . some say it kind of droned along for a while ,  but i found that created tension without ( us ) necessarily being conscious of it ,  and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chords , it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks ,  but realize it is just now moving .  yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there ,  but shi* happens . did anyone else see hugh's dirty shirt turn white  ( near the end , in the rain )  in  " australia "  ?  look how much money and people were behind that movie !  give the kid a break for gods sake !  all in all i think it was very well done .  only 2 things i would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-don't walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera ,  and i would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot ,  so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is .   my experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie , it just takes time to learn how to do it , then the time to actually do it ,  and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you'll need to have shot before you call  " post-production time !  "  imho ,  it looks like director/writer ryan jafri did his homework ,  and if this indeed is his first report card ,  i'd give him an  " a "  .  the rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin' . 
1	this is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film !  !  !  !  ripstein's locations are spectacular ,  extremely detailed and well lit ,  the dialogue is extraordinarily garcía márquez ,  no doubt about it .  fernando luján and marisa paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife .   you must see it !  !  ! 
0	i watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets .  that's a mullet every 5 minutes .  seriously though ,  this film is living proof that formula works .  if it ain't broke ,  it don't need fixin .  a streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine ,  a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'issues' .  pure magic . 
1	being a transplanted new yorker ,  i might be more critical than most in watching city hall .  but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created .   for example there's a reference to woerner's restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat .  there is or was a woerner's restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 .  it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts .   no surprise because the script was co-authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories .  he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film .   a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead ,  including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school .  the story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside city hall itself .   al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan ,  a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself .  he's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control ,  cusack finds more than he bargained for ,   danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york ,  his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal .  he's very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them ,  do aiello in .    city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa ,  one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen .  no one watches anyone else whenever he's on .   al pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed ,  he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself .  his is a complex part ,  he's a decent enough man ,  but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york .    for those who want to know about political life in the big apple ,  city hall is highly recommended . 
1	much like the comedy duo of its title ,   " the sunshine boys "  has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later .  it's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s .  this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film ,  perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote .   walter matthau plays willy clark ,  once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark ,  now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can't get a job in a potato chip commercial .  his nephew and agent ben  ( richard benjamin )  is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis  ( george burns )  for an abc-tv celebration of show business nostalgia .   nostalgia is what  " sunshine boys "  has going for it in spades ,  right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter's  " be a clown "  .  then there's the film's present-day setting in manhattan ,  where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound .  the periods collide in willy's glorious mess of a manhattan apartment ,  where framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags .  if you were alive in the 1970s like me ,  you might even feel like you were in that apartment .   willy clearly has been living there too long .  he's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils .  willy wakes up and picks up the phone .    " hello ,  who is this ?  "  a pause .   " never mind ,  it's the tea .  "   old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands ,  but simon's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold .  the amazing thing about  " the sunshine boys "  is how much it rubs your noses in willy's almost existential condition without turning you off at all .   " 89 years old and just like that ,  he dies of nothing' "  willy says of one old songwriting friend ,  before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed  " lady "  with  " baby "  .   burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis ,  but it's matthau who brings this one home ,  his make-up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this .  willy is obnoxious in the extreme ,  fully deserving ben's description  " crazy freakin' old man "  ,  but you root for him throughout ,  enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience .  his lines kill you ,  too ,  especially when he's trying to kill lewis ,  for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea .    " you're out of touch !  "  willy tells lewis at one point .   " i'm still in demand .  i'm still hot !  "    " if this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot ,  "  lewis replies .   director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way ,  with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance .  you never get the feeling you are watching a movie ,  one of  " the sunshine boys "  many charms ,  and ross's direction ,  like the acting of the three principals ,  goes a long way toward achieving that end .   comedy is hard ,  especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by ,  but  " the sunshine boys "  makes it all seem a pleasure ,  because ,  for us watching ,  it is . 
1	granted i had seen some  " speed racer "  ,  but i never really watched it and i had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five .  this one though i watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it .  it actually ended ,  the bad guys done in unlike nearly every american cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one transformers that ended with galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the autobots ,  dungeons and dragons with the kids never making it home ,  with gi joe with cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth .  this one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed ,  it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons .  as it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one android 16 used against cell in dragonball z ,  then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out .  then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings .  he would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called bobo in america .  the villains not only consisted of dr .  hell ,  but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head .  interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion . 
0	for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film ,  this film is ok as movie musicals ,  nothing special ,  just ok .  i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production ,  the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin .  first of all ,  for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production ,  let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play ,  the director ,  producer ,  and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer .  a real theatrical audition ,  whether it be for a play or a musical ,  rarely takes more than five minutes .  if you're auditioning as a dancer ,  you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once ,  you do it ,  and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out .  michael bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little .  the play is about these dancers .  first of all ,  director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie/zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach .  in the play ,  you never see zach .  .  . he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon .  cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry  ( a character who is not even in the play ) was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about .  major musical numbers were cut or rethought .  the opening number in the play  " i hope i get it "  shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated .  in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance  ( can you say  " audrey landers "  )  .   " goodbye 12 ,  goodbye 13 ,  hello love "  ,  a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as  " surprise ,  surprise "  mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie .  the show's most famous song ,   " what i did for love "  which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance ,  becomes just another standard love song in the film ,  performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie .  jeffrey hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers ,  the choreography has to be special .  there are a couple of good dancers in the film ,  the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie ,  michelle johnston as bebe ,  and janet jones as judy ,  but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do ,  yet audrey landers ,  who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time ,  is given one of the show's best numbers ,   " dance 10 ,  looks 3 .  "  i will admit that the finale ,   " one "  is dazzling ,  but you have to wait almost two hours for that .  i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage ,  this film might be worth a look ,  but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical .  .  . be afraid .  .  . be very afraid . 
1	the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing ,  that is what i guess makes him so mean .  i don't think most men will like this movie ,  especially if they ever cheated on their wife .  this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end .  but then ,  there you have it ,  a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say ,   " hokie as hell .  "  a pretty good movie until the end .  ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning .  and then there is the aftermath of what happened .  guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending .  i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end . 
0	i guess i am coming late to the party .  i just saw this 1995 version of bye bye birdy on sky tv .  i didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when i turned it on .   i played albert a long time ago and i am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because i remembered it as being so much fun to do .  i was not impressed with this newer version .  it just wasn't enough fun .  it was not colorful .  it lacked the exuberance of youth .  the lighting was bad .  no one seemed to mention this fact .  this is not a moody musical ,  it is bright and up beat .  the lighting decision was a poor creative choice .   bye bye birdy is a farce ,  a comedy of errors .  i got no sense of that in this version .  the lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances .  the dance numbers seemed anemic as well .  we do have music videos these day .  at least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those ,  or how about some of the best of broadway .  the choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed .   although all the actors were supremely talented ,  there were some really bad casting choices .  vanessa williams is not latin ,  and with so many talented latin performers out there ,  wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of rosie .  vanessa is african american ,  lovely and talented ,  but bad casting .  jason alexander's effort was astounding ,  he always does intelligent work ,  but he just wasn't albert .  he was miscast and i think that is obvious to most people who see this version .   the medium of film is not the medium of stage .  there needs to be translation from one medium to another .  the exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be translated to film .  there is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed .  the spirit ,  the essence of the production must be brought forth .  to me the 1963 film production of bye bye birdy was bright and lively ,  while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers .  it turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people . 
0	there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft .  all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less .  the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this stinking load .  hey genius .  .  .  . triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about asian culture .  the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless .  this dvd does prove useful i do love my new coaster .   so kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead . 
1	it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos .  even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene .  it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction .  it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie .  people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene .   the acting ,  plot ,  cinematography ,  and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma .  the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter .  the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them .    the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires .  not many films can make you feel this creeped out .  bottom line :  this movie is a classic .  i can't really say much more than that . 
0	jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires ,  aliens and the quest for immortality .   the women are beautiful and the photography stunning .  the dialog is inane .  its a laughable mess .  great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful .  i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not .  at the same time is it a put on or not ?  its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to  " mean "  anything ,  and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle .  something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women . 
0	this is one of the worst films ever .  i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful .  where are the images in the film that are on the box ?  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .    why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading ?  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box .  as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store .  i have no one to blame except myself .  i want my money and time back .    do not watch this movie .    even if curiosity is motivating you ,  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead .  it will be much more enjoyable .  you have been warned ! 
0	expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie ,  after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman ,  the 40 year-old virgin ,  and little miss sunshine .  boy ,  was i wrong .   i'll start with what is right with this movie :  at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell .  there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh ,  and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing .  he's an undoubtedly talented individual ,  and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be ,  in my opinion ,  a total train-wreck .   with that out of the way ,  i'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong .   the film begins with dan burns ,  a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column .  he prepares his girls for a family reunion ,  where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other .   the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie .  no family behaves like this .  it's almost as if they've been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver .  they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7 .  it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating .  touch football ,  crossword puzzle competitions ,  family bowling ,  and talent shows are not how actual people behave .  it's almost sickening .   another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for .  observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated .  what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded .   it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet .  i left the theater wondering what i just saw .  after thinking further ,  i don't think it was much . 
1	enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell ,   ( philo vance )  playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the  " thin man series "  .  back in the 1930's william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture ,  the famous veteran actress mary astor ,   ( hilda lake )  becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named ,  archer coe ,   ( robert barrot )  is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside .  ralph morgan ,   ( raymond wrede/archer's secretary )  gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared  " in the wizard of oz "  1939 .  eugene palette ,   ( detective sgt .  heath )  appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in  " robin hood "  with errol flynn .  always remember ,  the least likely actor could very well be the killer .  enjoy a great classic from the past . 
1	this film centers on four criminals ,  locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell ,  hoping that a mysterious book of black magic ,  penned by a former inmate around 1920 ,  named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young .   carrère's ( gérald laroche ) criminal business tactics ( shortcuts ) have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates .  . a transsexual brute marcus ( clovis cornillac )  ,  marcus' love-toy pâquerette ( dimitri rataud ) who eats objects he touches (  .  . and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister ) and obeys his charge as if  " he "  were his mother ,  and the scholarly lassalle ( philippe laudenbach ) who doesn't read ,  or eat breakfast (  .  . the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day )  .  the film follows carrère as he reads from the book ,  attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison .  carrère loves his child ,  and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail .  when she betrays him ,  carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate ,  and longing to see and hold his beloved son .  carrère's toughest critic is marcus ,  who longs to be fully female ,  while still folding to several masculine traits ,  such as working out and taking a leak standing up .  he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic ,  although deep inside is a world of vulnerability .  pâquerette is completely under marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master .  . there's even an alarming scene where pâquerette breast-feeds from marcus !  lassalle is an unraveling mystery ,  opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain .  clearly intellectual ,  and holding possible secrets from the others ,  lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going .  soon ,  those who aren't a threat to the book seek their  " true "  escape ,  not as much from the cell of four walls ,  but the cell that imprisons their true desires .  after a certain murder ,  the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant .  . who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away ,  and better yet ,  how to use it ?  a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach .   i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film .  it does play out like  " monkey's paw "  ,  the characters get what they desire ,  but a price must be met .  there's gore in the film ,  startling moments of graphic violence ,  but ,  in my opinion ,  this is first and foremost a story-driven tale .  the gore is a product of what the book unleashes .  one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air ,  while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire .  we see danver's fate at the end ,  with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away .  lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence .  i will say that maléfique ,  through eric valette's well paced direction ,  always kept my attention ,  and ,  for being such an isolated movie (  .  . about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location ,  the prison cell ) it never seems to drag .  i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations ,  not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them . 
0	r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way .  this time it is mixed with mature humors .   amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london .  he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job .  according to him ,  cooking is an art .  still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properly .   enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other amitabh is 65 and tabu is 35 .  no probs !  but one hitch !  tabu's father paresh rawal !  !  the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage .  but amitabh realizes that tabu's father is much younger to him .  and the complications begin performance wise all three actors are brilliant .  the script of the film is very tight and interesting .  the dialogues of the film are catchy .  but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled .  the comedy is sometimes not properly understood .  the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts .   musically nothing much to sing about except the title track .  the camera-work is good .  director r balki could have given much better from this script .  but in the second half he himself looks confused .  the  " satyagrah "  scene of the father looked irritating .  but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthy .   on the whole ,  cheeni kum needed to have more sugar ! 
0	jet li ,  is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world .  he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame .  while he is big in asia ,  he is almost unknown here in the us .   black mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him ,  but it fails horribly .  first of all ,  it is dubbed .  while it may have camp value  ( the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone )  ,  it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer .  secondly ,  the director in this movie ,  daniel lee ,  does a horrible job .  he cuts scenes so fast ,  at times ,  you don't know what's going on .  other times ,  the camera shakes and wobbles .  fans see jet li's movies for the fantastic martial arts .  however ,  the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time !  other times ,  a scene is left hanging  ( ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep ,  while the badguys arm their guns ,  two seconds later ,  both li and the love interest are already under the car !  )  other scenes are so improbable ,  that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous  ( killer cd roms ?  just give him throwing stars !  !  !  !  )  .  li ,  needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise-a-scene .  the added rap/techno music goes from being okay to intrusive .  the plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for .  and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon ,  because he has a half mask on ?  wouldn't the hair ,  lower jaw ,  or voice give it away ?   if you want to see a jet li movie ,  try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple .  this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time .  .  .  .  . 2/10
1	one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly .  i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters .  the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in life .  the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting .  also ,  although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to  ( i . e .  jewish/twins/family business )  the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it .  that made it very engaging . 
1	i admit that i am a vampire addict :  i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten .  i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it .  this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first ,  and it is not quite so dark ,  but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original .   jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss :  his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives .  one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems .  his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds .   the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film .  it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night .  there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme .   if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one .  if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else . 
1	far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's .  george c .  scott was born to be scrooge ,  just as he was born to be patton .  mr .  scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century .  the character of scrooge as played by mr .  scott seemed to jump off the screen .  scott as scrooge brought an richer ,  more robust ,  yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london .  mr .  scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal ,  understandable yet highly conflicted level ;  his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen :  yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper ,  almost as a soliloquy ,  as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath ,  yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line .  he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge ,  and a misunderstood ,  sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene .   truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation . 
0	i really ,  really wanted to like julian po .  i think that slater is underrated as an actor ,  and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film .  i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read .  so ,  i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story ,  or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter .  the premise is wonderful ,  and i loved the voiceover ,  confessional tone the opening narration strikes .  but then .  .  .  ?  nothing !  several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide .  one could argue that he doesn't answer ,  because it's none of their business .  but julian is the one who ,  under only token pressure ,  blurted out his intentions in public .  then neither julian nor the director/writer ,  despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake ,  seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life .  he says he was a bookkeeper .  he says his family moved around when he was a child ,  due to his father's job .  so what ?  there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose .  but none of them go anywhere ,  because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet ,  as if he were the ultimate  ( and only )  sane one among them .  this might work as an allegory ,  if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart .  the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive ,  religious wife of the mechanic .  and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian .  i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish ,  petty ,  and totally condescending .  sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked ,  contrived film .  and poor michael parks ,  an actor who once had so much promise ,  is given nothing to work with here . 
0	awful ,  simply awful .  it proves my theory about  " star power .  "  this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed  ( battlestar )  titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick .  b o r i n g .   find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound .  1/10  ( i rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb . com rating system .  )   -zaphoid  ps :  my theory about  " star power "  is :  the more  " star power "  used in a show ,  the weaker the show is .   ( it's called an indirect proportionality :  quality 1/ " star power "  ,  less  " sp "  makes for better quality ,  etc .  another way to look at it is :   " more is less .  "  )   -z
0	strummer's hippie past was a revelation ,  but overall this felt like crashing a wake .  campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire .  there were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage .  i love the clash and joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now  ( fu mick jones )  ,  but this doc left me wanting .  . to relate more .  using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent .  they should have been interviewed on their own .  even using strummer's 'radio dj voice' did little to glue the film together .  and can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes ?  after the awesome  " filth and the fury "  i hoped temple could deliver .  a joe strummer doc deserves better . 
1	this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me .  it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film .  it's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film .  the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff .  it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to .  her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed .  it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary ,  and i have seen most of her films .  her character ,  yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song ,  'i want to blow you .  .  .   .  .  .   .  .  .  up' .  you also feel sorry for her ,  as her performance really grasps you ,  yonica is a very complex and confused character .  joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour ,  but also her facial expressions and so on .  john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout .  i strongly recommend this film . 
1	i can't believe i am just now seeing this film -- i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated ,  and i avoided roots for the same reason -- just as i have yet to see schindler's list -- i don't want to be  " entertained "  by other peoples' pain ,  not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be .   so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites .  the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their  " husbands "  .  it was painful to watch ,  but everyone redeemed himself in the end ,  and the acting was phenomenal !  i couldn't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 !  and i adore whoopi to start with - she was amazing .  i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple . 
1	i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum ,  all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers .  the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right ,  making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent .  equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist .  his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving .  i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian . 
0	alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this !  the plot holds much potential for suspense .  john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is scarily cast against type .  nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable .   yes it starts to sag fairly early .  there are too many coincidences .  and an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more ,  in the end ,  than a love story .   it's fun to watch for garfield ,  massey ,  and the character performers .  but it's not awfully good . 
0	slow and nice images changed one another ,  with sometimes annoying music  ( you know bjork )  in background ,  for the first 75% of the movie .  if you did not have enough sleep ,  that's a good time .    but ,  in the last 20% of the movie director decides to bring idea of re-birth ,  re-incarnation or else ,  through s&m images :   " spiritual lovers "  are cutting each others bodies with knives .  for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery .    operator and director are great ,  but weird .    did not enjoy it at all . 
1	first off ,  consider that this film is nearly fifty years old !  yet ,  it still stands up as one of the great films of all time .  i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050 ?   the story is simple ,  yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day .  i can still recall the first time i watched this ,  as a kid ,  when the monster enters the force-field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first  ( and only )  time .  had me shivering in fear ,  i can tell you .  looks dated today ,  but still more than effective enough .   the scenes with the tiger show their age now .  you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira ,  but they are only just visible .   likewise ,  the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done .   it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen  ( better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies )  as a young ,  but still mature man .  he was 30 when this film came out !  nearly 80 now !   all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come .  timeless . 
0	i don't have much to say about this movie .  it could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for peter sellers ,  but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history .  that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful .   the terrible screenplay ,  direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever made .   i wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber ,  but it's a lifeless ,  humorless disaster .  the truth hurts .   peter ,  why couldn't you have stopped at being there ? 
0	acting is horrible .  this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film .  they throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story .  there is a reason why people on the internet aren't even downloading this movie .  this movie sunk like an iron turd .  do not waste your time renting or even downloading it .  this film is and always will be a perma-turd .  i am now dumber for having watched it .  in fact this title should be referred to as a  " perma-turd "  from now on .  calling it a film is a travesty and insult .  abhorrent ,  abominable ,  appalling ,  awful ,  beastly ,  cruel ,  detestable ,  disagreeable ,  disgusting ,  dreadful ,  eerie ,  execrable ,  fairy ,  fearful ,  frightful ,  ghastly ,  grim ,  grisly ,  gruesome ,  heinous ,  hideous ,  horrendous ,  horrid ,  loathsome ,  lousy ,  lurid ,  mean ,  nasty ,  obnoxious ,  offensive ,  repellent ,  repulsive ,  revolting ,  scandalous ,  scary ,  shameful ,  shocking ,  sickie ,  terrible ,  terrifying ,  ungodly ,  unholy ,  unkind
0	i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck .  it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of .  it was a bad premise to begin with ,  first pregnant male ,  but then they tried to make it a spoof .  what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males ?  ?  ?  this was the worst movie i have ever seen .  if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom 100 .  if it was possible to give it a zero i would ,  and i would still feel i had given it too much credit . 
1	noni hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance  ( which won her an afi award )  is at least on par with her effort in fran three years later .  colin friels is also good ,  and ,  for those who are interested ,  alice garner appears as noni's child ,  and michael caton  ( best known for the castle )  is a bearded painter .   ( also interestingly ,  hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens ,  and caton is the host of property-type programs including hot property ,  hot auction ,  etc .  .  .  )  this film reaffirms the popularly-held belief that noni was arguably australia's top female actor during the early-to-mid 1980s .  rating :  79/100 . 
0	this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched .  i couldn't sit through the whole thing .  i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping .  .  .  i mean what was that all about !  i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a £4 rental fee .  the quality both picture and sound are terrible ,  the acting .  .  .  well doesn't exist  .  it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee ,  crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup .  urghh .  .  .  .  .  .  .  avoid at all cost !  the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off .  .  .  while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears .   this was like  ( possibly worse )  than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car ?  !    definatey not one to buy folks .  sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have . 
1	good luck finding this film to even watch - it's not yet released on tape or dvd .  i saw on release in the early '70's ,  was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheque's preservation efforts ,  and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years .   no reason to repeat rwint's accurate comments here .  as a come-out director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces ,  jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible ,  and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re-cutting .  but it's also a memorable icon for it's time :  the all very intense clashes of late 60's college sports ,  student movements ,  sexual revolution ,  and more .    why see this film ?  it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes :  the frisky male bonding in the after-game showers ;  karen black's scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it's the first use of a word i hadn't witnessed in film before ;  and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall .  there are probably others i'm omitting .   look for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films ;  a thin david ogend stiers ;  mike warren fresh out of his powder-blue ucla uniform and readying for a dark-blue tv uniform ;  robert towne - actor ;  and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves .   now :  any connection between harry gittes last name ,  robert towne ,  and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakes ?   it gets a  " 7 "  based on karen black .  you'll see why . 
1	and a made for tv movie too ,  this movie was good .  the acting in it and the plot was just so great .  this one of the only movies i've seen that i felt warped my mind because after seeing it i was afraid of reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen .  there were just a few minor things wrong with this movie ,  but it's very easily over looked .   antonio sabbato jr did an excellent role in this movie along with janine turner and robert wagner .  this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because i never thought a low budget tv movie could be so powerful .  after viewing this i read the novel this movie was based on  ( four times )  and it too kicked was great .  if you ever see this movie come on tv ,  i'd watch it .  the effects in this movie were pretty well done ,  i honestly don't know what a live calcifying human would look like but with the way the fx team did this movie i was impressed and all it shows is that all these bad made for tv movies out there with low budgets shouldn't suck so bad .   watch it .  it's really good ,  no really ,  it is ! 
0	epsilon ,  a . k . a .  alien visitor ,  is not what i expected .  this is a no-budget australian film with no special effects other than speeded-up film and quick scene cuts .  the female alien  ( who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly accented australian )  can  " blip "  from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the  " faster "  humans .   an elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before ,  when an unnamed  " she "  came to the planet naked and completely disoriented ,  unable to recognize which star in the sky she came from .  .  . she meets a man alone camping in the australian outback ,  apparently bewildering him .  she is here by  " mistake "  ,  and gets angry when she is told she is on earth .  the earthlings are known as consummate despoilers of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe :  those who  " breathe the foul air "  but do nothing about it ,  sticking their heads under the sand like an ostrich .  in another amusing metaphor ,  earthlings are  " frogs "  .   from there ,  it is entirely a film about dialogue ,  as the perplexed man tries to understand she's peculiar psychology and viewpoints ,  even as she calls him unintelligent and  " quaint "  .  the man begins to realize maybe it's humans who are irrational and not thinking straight .  yet ,  while waiting to be  " beamed up "  back home ,  she sees that this human is not entirely faulty in his thinking and even falls in love with him .   the dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting ,  but it is all layered with a heavy-handed environmental message and a low-budget feel  ( there are only two main actors ,  who blip around various deserted scenes ,  and the evil despoiling humans on the planet are never seen at all )  .  the environmental message offers no solutions ,  but paints one or two dire metaphors about what will happen to nature and man if something isn't done .  the logic also doesn't hang together :  the rest of the universe has  " given up "  on earth ,  yet one space woman caught on earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie .  what would a battalion of aliens deliberately sent here manage to achieve against pollution and waste ? 
0	this was a watershed event in my movie watching life .  i went to see this in the theater when it came out .  i was completely amazed at just how bad it was .  movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very ,  very large favor .  the special effects are absolutely first grade level ,  as in any first grader could have done them .  toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings ,  arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign ,  and a laughable story line .  ed wood made masterpieces compared to  " conquest "  .  every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie . 
1	bill and ted's bogus journey is the sequel to bill and ted's excellent adventure .  their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie ,  and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer .   the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted .  once the robots kill bill and ted ,  they must compete with the grim reaper  ( death )  and return their lives to normal .   the acting in the movie is top notch ,  and even thought it is a little weird at times ,  especially bill and ted's conversations ,  it is a great movie .  the wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie .  pick this up the next time your at blockbuster ! 
0	one of my sisters friends lent me this game ,  and it is too damn hard !  it carries the appearance of a kids game ,  but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions ,  and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes ,  to improve your 'score' !  you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces ,  that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them !  and i am only up to stage three !  !  !  !  !  maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this ,  but otherwise keep away !  and it is definately not recommended for kids - they will pull their hair out within the hour ! 
0	up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan .  however ,  the new season had absolutely ruined it .   the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show .  it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice .  the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light .   i am neither christian or muslim ,  but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend .  not any more .   just cancel it and be done with it .  it's not worth watching any more .   it might still be saved ,  but a lot of change would need to be made .   bring back the old format . 
0	this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff .  well ,  then let me bash it to .  compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays ,  this film isn't too bad .  it has the beautiful leslie cumming .  she is super hot ,  but can't talk very well .  there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped .  she shows off her nice body .  linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff .  3/10
1	this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family .  when leo ,  the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus ,  announces it to his parents ,  they just can't believe it .  the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject .   the director ,  christophe honore ,  has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen .  nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter .   the news has a devastating effect on marcel ,  the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted ,  in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality .   yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers . 
0	i had a video of the thing .  and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep .  it's slow-moving ,  and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform ,  which may have been revolutionary at the time ,  is now just a great big yawnaroony .  apart from conrad veidt ,  the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable ,  and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting .  when the water started to spill big-time it even ,  on one occasion ,  woke me up .   but give the man his due .  no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt .  he doesn't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals .  he holds it in his fingers ,  while showing us the old pearly-browns .  there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done .  but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke . 
1	mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment .  instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony ,  humor ,  elequence ,  and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel .   this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date .  he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr .  consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes .   alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft .  sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover .  john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's  " blue fairy godmother .  "   this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people .  and aside from that ,  it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across .  cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love .  and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion ,  he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish .  and he realizes that .  .  . well ,  watch the movie and you'll see .   mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made .  it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author . 
1	once again ,  i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4 . 88 .  fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap  ( i mean horrible beyond belief )  but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good .  this movie is much better than i expected .  i found it very engaging ,  though it was obviously made by an amateur .    the direction is nothing special ,  but the story is intriguing with some good thrills .  i expected it to be more of a comedy ,  but i wasn't too disappointed .    for a thriller ,  this movie is surprisingly good-natured .  there's no bloody violence ,  no profanity ,  no nudity ,  no sex .  usually ,  these movies require all four of those elements .  the pg rating is well-deserved--not like  " sixteen candles "  where the  " f "  word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene .    i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more .  the film does tend to be plot-heavy ,  and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side .  instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them ,  we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors .  they end up kissing at the end ,  but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced .    " the dream machine "  is no gem ,  but it's good ,  clean entertainment .  it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns ,  except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect .    my score :  7  ( out of 10 ) 
1	i've always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox ,  although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david ,  the monarch with a wandering eye .   a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film ,  adultery ,  redemption ,  sin ,  punishment and generally what god expects from his followers .   when you're a king ,  even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us .  king david has many wives ,  including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul ,  david's predecessor .  but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening .  turns out she's as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women .  uriah is one of david's army captains .  david sends for bathsheba and him being the king ,  she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too .   what happens ,  an affair ,  a pregnancy ,  and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle .  but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba ,  but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought ,  disease ,  and pestilence .   the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death .  david shows weakness in his previous actions ,  but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him .  he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film .   my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both .  bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until they're both conquered .   susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore .  the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle .  i liked kieron moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear .    no one can lay the law down like raymond massey .  his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films ,  same intensity .    so when his own law called for death ,  why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne .  maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job .  he'd replaced saul with david already .    but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming ,  that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently .  i'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations .   watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory . 
1	******warning :  may contain spoilers**************  so who are these  " mystery men ?  "  simply put ,  the mystery men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities .  the shoveller  ( bill macy )  works construction during the day ,  and at night ,  leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style .  the blue raja  ( hank azaria )  sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night ,  if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping .  mr .  furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay ,  then takes out his frustration on his friends at night ,  tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry  ( leaving everyone to wonder ,  so what ?  )  .  ben stiller breathes such life into this character ,  you can't help but love him .   these three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about .  .  .  becoming real super heroes .  obviously ,  it could happen .  champion city has captain amazing ,  after all .  .  .  a flying ,  fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two .  greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career .   to bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again ,  c . a .  frees casanova frankenstein ,  a waaaaay over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush .  this lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities .  .  .  and ends up capturing c . a .  within hours of his release from prison .  this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein's evil plan ,  but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein ,  the trio are going to need a little help .   recruiting commences ,  and after a painful recruitment party ,  the team settles in with the bowler  ( janeane garofolo )  ,  who initially has the only real talent in the team ,  with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father ;  the invisible boy  ( kel mitchell )  ,  who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him ;  the spleen  ( paul reubens )  ,  granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy ;  and the much underused sphinx  ( wes studi )  ,  who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind ,  then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise .   this film really is a cross-genre romp .  anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle .  this is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly  ( and occasionally decorated with more spoof material )  to the ridiculous costumes ,  the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up .  but at the same time ,  it is a serious superhero flick ,  as well .  both at once .  while not a necessarily unique idea in itself  ( for example ,  this movie is in some ways reflective of d . c .  comic's short-lived inferior five work )  ,  it is fairly innovative for the big screen .  it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway ,  then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know ,  if superheroes were real ,  so would these guys be real .  if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city ,  you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis .  sure ,  the shoveller fights pretty well ,  and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world .  but does that make them genuine super-heroes ?  only in their minds .   this movie is also a comedy ,  albeit a dark one .  inevitable ,  when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics .  one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of .  particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball/father .  yet ,  it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes .  it mixes in a dose of drama ,  of discovery and of romance ,  but never really ventures fully into any of it .   what really makes mystery men a good film ,  in the end ,  is that it is very engaging .  the weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and ,  for one shining moment ,  really become super-heroes ;  justice is served ;  and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism  ( as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise )  .  if the viewer stops trying to label the film ,  then the film can be a great romp .   of course ,  no movie is perfect .  claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr .  furious' love interest ,  in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience .  tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr .  heller ,  although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone .  and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys  ( a point of which is made in the film )  .  the cinematography is choppy and disjointed  ( such as happens in the average comic book ,  so it is excusable )  ,  the music sometimes overpowers the scenery ,  and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well .   yet ,  overall ,  this film is incredible .  you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie ,  but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest .   8/10 in my opinion . 
1	saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing .  i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one .  it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty .  but ,  i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in china was tough to say the least .  be prepared to watch segments about famine ,  death and disease .   about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni .  while he was an exceptionally talented man ,  it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era .  if you are paying attention at all ,  it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part . 
1	i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie ,  and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world .  really .  .  .  are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment ?  this movie is not entertainment ,  at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator .  it has style ,  it is different ,  it is shocking .  .  .  that's why most of you have hated it so much :  because it does not try to be pleasing to you .  it's just a story ,  a very weird one i admit ,  but after all ,  only a weird story .  it is not a great story ,  not even a great cinema work ,  but i believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience ,  thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer .  this movie is ,  for me ,  european-artistic-like movie made in the us ,  and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect .  be it for the courage ,  or be it for the unique sense of humor . 
1	there is great detail in a bug's life .  everything is covered .  the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping .  the film isn't too terribly orignal ,  it's basically a modern take on kurosawa's seven samurai ,  only with bugs .  i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad .  it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs .  the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper ,  the lead bad guy ,  was a brillant creation .  check this one out . 
1	this is a poem on film ,  wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry .  it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly .   ( italy's lake district in the twenties .  )  it's a love story with a twist .  the characters are unique and believable .  the settings are deliciously exotic .  some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images .  and rather than the mandatory happy ending ,  this story has a bitter sweet one .  if film is an art ,  this is close to a masterpiece .   
1	spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence .  in an early episode of cartoon  " family guy "  the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there .  way back in 1949 however ,  the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea .   after a child's prank ,  the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure .  at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy .  withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain ,  the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state .   based at a time when rationing was still in operation ,  this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring .  featuring performances by stanley holloway ,  betty warren ,  philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey ,  the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation .  these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines .  feeling remarkably fresh ,  despite being over 50 years old ,  the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained .   ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence .  with films like  " passport to pimlico "  it's not difficult to see why .  amusing from start to finish ,  the story is always fun and always worth watching . 
0	this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie ,  and definitely the hottest women ,  but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen .   here is the plot ,  and if you read it with a little inflection ,  you have the acting as well .   beginning ,  bring in characters ,  hot woman singing  ( obvious lip sync )  .  music agent or producer comes in ,  thinks that she is awesome asks her to race .  she turns down ,  too many bad memories .  flash to war hero ,  back from war ,  has several fights ,  and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone .  drive off in fast exotic car .  brother races ,  then dies .  hero to avenge death ,  cut away to getting weapons from friend .   ( you have never seen this friend before or after ,  but seems to really care about him )  are you sure you want to do this ;  yes ;  i mean are you really sure ;  yes ,  give me weapons ;  are you really sure ;  yes ;  ok ,  i guess i can't talk you out of it ,  be careful man ,  i love you .   now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove .  finds woman ,  decides to rescue her ,  she drives off ,  and he doesn't finish killing his uncle .  now there will be a race to finish the movie .  oh yeah ,  need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter ,  but maybe it adds a little plot .  race is not even that exciting ,  of course it ends with two cars racing ,  and one that should win throws in a surprise ending .   ok ,  i just saved you $7 . 00 .  you can send all of your money to me ,  because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does .  don't get me wrong ,  the cars are awesome ,  and nadija is beautiful ,  but it is truly an awful movie . 
1	just the kind of movie i love .  some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone .  catherine tramell  ( stone )  masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives ,  playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book .  she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows .  tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the 'never visit after dark' side of town .  from the beginning ,  there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone .  stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter ,  an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan . 
1	i love this film .  it's one of those i can watch again and again .  it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded .   the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller .  either would have killed the film completely .   the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor throughout .   it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes .  .  .   ( no that's not a spoiler !  ) 
0	very bad movie .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . and i mean very bad .  .  . the plot is predictable ,  and it's eally cheesy ,  the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one ,  other than that .  .  . this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch .  .  .  .  . i feel while watching the movie ,  the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché .  .  .  . bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah ,  but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy ,  very poorly portrayed from idea to screen ,  i think .  the plot is somewhat predictable at times ,  tho the dancing i can say at times ,  is pretty good ,  the break dance battle twist was good .  .  .  .  . if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5 .  .  . lol
0	i saw and liked the first two a lot ,  really .  especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first .  and it's a story standing alone .  you don't have to know the first movie .  i liked that in the  " free willy "  movies ,  too .   but .  .  .  the third ,  here is absolutely useless !  i tried it with a friend of mine ,  because we both liked the first two .  we decided to stop after a good half an hour .  the movie is okay ,  there are funny parts in it alright .  but what for ?  timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies .  what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is :  a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already ,  plus telling the story from their point of view .  but what for ?  i'd really like to know .  you know ,  the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one ,  is really nice .  but what comes after is mostly unnecessary .  i guess many people liked timon and pumba ,  and so do i really .  yet ,  for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny .  no chance ,  most of it wasn't funny at all ,  at least for me .  btw .  what was the movie about anyway ?  was it a )  about timon and pumba or b )  an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie ?  i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it .   if you like to see stories like :   " the story behind xy "  ,  you should see  " rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead "  by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman .  that's really funny and no try to get more out of  " hamlet "  then it has . 
1	the danes character finally let's buddy have the awful truth .   "  " leave me alone ,  kiss men if you want to ,  "  she screams self-righteously in front of everyone ,  thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long .  nice girl .  this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character .  great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying ,  but hey ,  remember ,  there are no mistakes ,  except ,  maybe ,  seeing this film .    wait a minute .  this irony is intended !  this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit ,  yes !  but somehow i doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind ,  sadly .  maybe there are a few mistakes ,  after all . 
1	who's got the gold ?  is  ( unfortunately )  the last of the hanzo the razor films ,  starring shintaro katsu as the title character - the multi-weapon proficient ,  authority-bucking samurai officer with the  " unique "  technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they  " spill the beans "  and beg for more .  .  .   this entry starts with hanzo  " uncovering "  a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that's filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury .  this leads to hanzo discovering a loan-sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk .  the requisite swordplay and rape/interrogation ensue - finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films .   not quite as strong and enjoyable as the snare  ( part 2 of the series .  .  .  )  ,  but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese pinky-style films .  8/10
1	we toss around the term  " superstar "  way too lightly these days ,  but here's one guy that truly deserves it .   i was glued to the set this entire show .  the song selection was perfect -- it only contained the songs i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs .  i loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment .   ( with songs of this strength ,  you don't need a circus to be entertained )  .   the shots of the crowd were amazing ,  too .  how many performers can affect the original beatles fans  ( now in their 50's and beyond )  ,  get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of  " can't buy me love "  and impact everyone in between ?    while watching ,  i also realized that in the wake of john lennon's tragic death ,  paul mccartney instantly became an afterthought .  paul not only lost john and george  ( no matter what their final relations were ,  it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world )  ,  but he also lost his wife linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment lennon's murder received .  i agree that lennon's murder was horrible ,  but only now did i realize that paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath .  i was very happy that he's found love again in heather .   as for those complaining about the audio/video quality ,  i had no complaints whatsoever ;  both were crystal clear on my set .  i think these same people will complain about the quality of dvd when the next format comes out ;  they'll never be satisfied .   my only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when i had the chance .  thanks to this video i was able to enjoy it .   when people remember john lennon ,  they will first remember his murder and then his music .  i now have a new appreciation for paul mccartney ,  because ,  if nothing else ,  he will be remembered for his music first .  and let's hope another lunatic won't change this ,  because the mccartney catalog is pretty good . 
0	this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed .  if they want to make a movie with a lousy story ,  they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book .  there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title .  i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen .  at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product .  the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing .  the actors are miscast .  the director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon .   if you've seen this movie and disliked it ,  try the book .  if you've seen this movie and liked it ,  read the book . 
1	 " scarface "  has a major cult following even now ,  22 years after its release .   it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky ,  unrefined ,  over-the-top and all bloated up !  these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies .  it is true that on the technical front ,   ( cinematography ,  screenplay ,  direction ,  etc .  )  scarface is way behind 'the godfather' .   but it is also true ,  that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack ,  is the rawness ,  the sheer crude approach of the gangsters .  the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' .  this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as  " tackiness "  by most critics !  i have seen the original 1932 scarface ,  and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the  " remake "  !    al pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie .  but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted tony montana's character to be !  he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute !  he is not the calm michael corleone here .  he is tony montana ,  a very tacky ,  uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time !   there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie .  the soundtrack is all 80s !  i love some of the songs ,  including 'gina and elvira's theme' ,  'push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental .   there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences ,  including the famous chainsaw scene ,  the rebenga hit ,  the first meeting with sosa and tony's visit to his mother's .   about the performances :  al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee .  he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career .  and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes !  one wonders what  " scarface "  would be like without pacino .  i just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities ,  the film wouldn't be as effective without him !   steven bauer shines as tony's friend manny .   robert loggia is wonderful as tony's boss ,  lopez .  so is f .  murray abraham  ( as omar )  in a small role .   then there is some eye-candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer .  she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role .   the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax .  without revealing anything ,  i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling .    " scarface "  is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out .  enjoy it for what it is :  a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland ! 
0	i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing .  this  " film "  wasn't worth the memorex dvd-r it was burned on ;  i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder .  this is by far the worst movie ever made .  i truly ,  from the bottom of my heart ,  want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life .   so apparently ,  it's supposed to be bad on purpose ;  however ,  if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo ,  you'll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick .  the actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marine .   the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg .  the camera angles are awful .  the story is c-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b-movie caliber .  the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty ,  but is crap like everything else .  rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies .  plus ,  the techno score is annoying .  .  .  not because it's techno ,  but because it's non-stop .  that's right ,  the music plays in the background the whole time ,  acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is .  i don't care what the disclaimer claims ,  i don't buy it .  bots was not made this bad on purpose ,  because it takes itself way too serious for what it was :  a joke .   this  " film "  was very low-budget .  but that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor .  great films are born of substance ,  not budget .  bots had neither .   allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time :  if i were having a three-way with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on ,  i'd be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decision .   undoubtedly ,  some people will try to defend the movie .  two ,  maybe three .  they'll say ,   " it's grindhouse chop-socky !  "  or  " cheesy in a good way !  "  or  " it's so bad ,  it's good !  "  those people are idiots .  a movie is either good ,  or it's bad .  there's no such thing as a good bad movie .  but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies .  don't get me wrong ;  there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining .  slither is one .  bots is not .   this suckfest runs about an hour and a half ,  and in my humble opinion ,  it's 90 minutes too long .  the best thing about this  " film "  is the dvd cover ,  so next time you're near the wal-mart dvd bargain bin ,  take a look at it-- don't touch it ,  just look-- and quietly walk away . 
0	 ( spoilers in this )    " rosenstraße "  is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time .  but it is way too long ,  it is not touching and sometimes even boring !  there are too many clichés and not enough good acting .   the storytelling  ( storyline )  is bad .  like in james cameron´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live .  good ,  now we´ve got a point of view .  than there is another woman introduced who does the same .  confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people !  come on !  this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling .  .  . how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for example ?   the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place .  for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian .  when did that happen ?  the scene looks like it is set in the twenties .  .  .   riemann´s character is of course a talented pianist ,  well ,  she is even a baroness !  wow .  her brother comes back from the eastern front ,  he has received a  " ritterkreuz "  which he is showing in some scenes .  so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience .  and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans .  he even made some photographs !  and so it goes ,  cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work .   basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie .  and in the end it´s all very simple .  riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and - ta da !  - everyone is free .  which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the  " true story "  claim at the beginning .  like  " sass "  it is vaguely based on a true event .   it is sad but true ,  this is the typical german movie these days .  it is bad !  macaulay j .  connor  
1	cinderella takes me back ,  when i was a little girl i loved the princesses of disney .  cinderella was one of my favorites because i always was so enchanted by the story .  any child or family members will enjoy this wonderful and magical story .   we have cinderella who is a beautiful girl enslaved by her wicked step mother and ugly step sisters .  she cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks .  the only friends she has in the world are the mice in the attic that are so charming and musical .  when the ladies receive an invitation to the king's ball to find a lady for his son ,  the prince ,  a . k . a .  prince charming ,  they all get excited ,  cinderella overhears the exciting news and asks if she could come too .  her step mother makes a false promise and says if she does her chores and such ,  she can come too .  of course ,  she doesn't keep her promise and destroys a beautiful dress she and the mice made for the ball .  leaving poor cinderella behind ,  a wonderful thing happens ,  cinderella's fairy god mother appears and creates a beautiful dress and carriage out of things from around the house and even makes the mice and horses into elegant horses and a driver for the carriage .  when the prince sees cinderella at the ball ,  he has fallen hard for her .  all the ladies are jealous ,  including her step mother and sisters .  but cinderella must return home at midnight when the spell is broken ,  all she leaves behind is her glass slipper .  the next day the prince is on a hunt to find this girl who fits the slipper and is making a stop at cinderella's house where her step mother has found out about her night and locks her in her room .    can she escape in time to tell the prince that it was her at the ball ?  you'll just have to find out .  trust me ,  this is a true disney classic with beautiful animation and classic music that is so charming .  you can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece .  a dream is a wish your heart makes ,  this movie captures everything a girl could want .   9/10
1	this is one of those movies that you wish you hadn't seen before - so you could see it again  "  for the first time  "   .  van dine's books still bring pleasure - but are termed excessively flowery by many  .  this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works  .  william powell is william powell - say no more  .  the plot is intricate  .  the story moves all too quickly  ,  because you want it to last  .  enjoy . 
0	simply ,  i found the tv show  " mash "  trite ,  preachy ,  oh ever so  " politically correct "  ,  repetitious ,  pretentious and biggest sin of all ,  and that is ,  ?  that it is  ( was )  incredibly dull .  you have alan alda as the main lead ,   "  ( star )  "  ,  who is so in love with himself and his cleverness ,  that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode .  the original series had both mclean stevson ,  and wayne rogers ,  whom i'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation .  however ,  harry  ( henry )  morgan ,  and mike farrell ,  both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with wonder bread .  loretta swit ,  which i also found dull ,  also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at ,  and gary burghoff ,  who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on .  seeing one show a year showed that to me .  jamie farr was just low brow  " comedy "  and is not even worth really mentioning here at all .  the reason i did not give it a  ( one )  rating ,  which anyone reading this by now would be wondering ,  is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call ,  but a relative one .  television ,  except for relatively few exceptions ,  is such crud .  that relatively speaking ,  mash had some production quality ,   ( by television standards )  of that era and today ,  and therefore it is deserved of a two .  rob ritter
0	there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can't possibly name but a few :   bogart's character :  1 .  his name  whip mccord  ( too easy ,  so i'll leave it at that .  boy ,  it makes `humphrey' sound good .  )  2 .  his long ,  curly hair and silly sideburns .  3 .  his black bart get-up ,  complete with spurs !  4 .  not sure what shade of lipgloss they've got him wearing ,  but it ain't none too flattering .   cagney's character  ( jim kincaid  )  :  1 .  his lipstick doesn't do him any favors ,  either .  2 .  the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film !  could they not find a hat to fit him ?  even a little ?  !  !  ?  !  3 .  his pants are too tight in the rear .  4 .  he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times ,  if you know what i mean ,  and i think you do .   if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan ,  and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western ,  do yourself a favor and forget that thought .  even the horses look embarrassed !   ( that is ,  when they don't look bored .  )   in all fairness ,  i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre ,  but i've still seen much ,  much better than this .   on a comedy level ,  or as high camp ,  the oklahoma kid works .  otherwise ,  it's viewer beware .  therefore ,  see this only if a )  you must see every western out there b )  you are a true cagney or bogie completist c )  any of the above comments appeal to you .  woah .  . 
1	'umi wa miteita'  ( 'the sea is watching' )  was akira kurasawa's swansong to film :  his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career .  director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image .   set in 19th century japan ,  the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men .  the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers .  each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha .  oshin  ( nagiko tono )  supports her family who live in a neighboring village ,  kikuno  ( misa shimizu )  has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste .  oshin befriends an endangered samurai ,  falls in love with the gentle fellow ,  only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed .  oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically/monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas .   a handsome samurai ryosuke  ( masatoshi nagase )  enters oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her .  kikuno is beset by problems ,  deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her ,  and coping with a rich but abusive customer .  all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street ,  oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke .  the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice ,  love ,  and devotion .  the sea is watching and will find protection for true love .   the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful :  night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent .  the acting is a bit strained for edo art ,  but the characters are well created and keep the story credible .  the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track .  but in the end there is enough of kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema .  grady harp
1	every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human .  lawrence kasden done this again .  i always felt thebg cill was the anthem of it's age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon .  every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it .  this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice .  the juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius .  i have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film .  danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great tenderness and stever martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless .  thank you again mr .  kasden
0	wow ,  i just saw this on t . v .  as one of the  " scary "  movies they show around halloween .  was this rated g ?  there wasn't really anything to make this movie scary ,  or worth watching .  also ,  other people say this is a spoof ,  but i don't think so .  for a spoof ,  you need something called  " humor "  .  this low-budget crap-fest didn't have a shred of humor ,  and it didn't make much sense ,  either .  you basically have a goofy looking monster  ( man in rubber suit )  coming out of closets ,  killing people ,  i guess ,  since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath .  the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster ,  so i guess that's good enough .   the military tries feebly to kill the monster ,  which isn't much larger than a man .  they have very bad aim .  then the military flees !  wow ,  did this movie make the u . s .  military look pathetic or what ?  the monster ,  while hard to kill ,  doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar .  oh ,  and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks .  it was a slightly interesting ,  yet a total alien ripoff .   what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster ?  it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality .  also ,  why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ?  why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance ?  why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ? 
1	this movie ,  to me ,  is about family .  jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself ,  but for his family .  i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city chiefs .  she'd think it was the coolest thing ,  like morris' son did .  living dreams with the family is what this one is about .  i think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what jimmy morris did . 
1	aardman does it again .  next to pixar ,  aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly .   i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts .  i thought it translated well for american audiences .  my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show .   having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film ,  i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this .  the animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal .  look at the first episode with the goat ,  who sounds stoned ,  and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other  " dawg "  .   is this for everyone ?  not by a long shot .  in fact ,  i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season .  but like i said before ,  audiences aren't going to get it . 
0	frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns .  he was a great actor ,  from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that ,  but he did not have the physique of a western hero ,  you identified him as an urban guy .  but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho ,  the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault .  i blame it on two factors :  a )  the story was too unusual ,  specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie .  in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern ,  to break away from it the film has to be very good .  b )  the story is not convincing ,  it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother .  also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible ,  why all the gunfighters have not adopted it ?  i think that this film should not have been withdrawn ,  because any film with sinatra is worth seeing ,  and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
1	i loved this movie !  it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it ,  but it is really very uplifting .  i was struck by the performance of ray liotta ,  but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event .  but tom's character ,  though heartbreaking ,  knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life .  this is a great movie ,  don't miss it !  ! 
0	after finally viewing this movie in its entirety ,  i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike .  is it the worst western ever ?  no ,  i wouldn't say that .  but  " the last great american western "  ,  a phrase i saw applied to it more than once ?  not even close .   a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue ,  and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i've ever seen .  the movie can be measured in groaners per minute ;  as in ,  how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life ?  there's so many instances of this that it's distracting .  cheesy lines come at you in waves ;  predictable ,  unoriginal ,  and often .    if bad dialogue doesn't bother you ,  then how about bad gunfights ?  few westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously .  it's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting ,  such as in silverado ,  but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns .  the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score ,  but by then ,  i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving .   other than those flaws ,  i can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great .  the acting is passable ,  especially considering what the actors were given to work with .  however ,  if you're looking for the last great american western ,  do yourself a favor - go rent unforgiven instead .   3 out of 10
0	a difficult film to categorize .  i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were .  nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows ,  not acted out .   this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show ,  with a largely insignificant sub plot going on ,  which just seemed to get in the way .  however as any irwin show is always worth a watch ,  this film is well worth a look too ,  but not on christmas day .  talking of which ,  i've better things to do too than be on here .   a high 4/10
0	when i bought this dvd i though :   " it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards let's give it a chance "  i was totally wrong !  what a disappointing movie !  first ,  it's not a comedy ;  it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many portuguese soap operas !  second ,  the plot is so boring ,  and leads nowhere it has no structure ,  it just flows ,  like the wind ,  in one or another direction the production is also bad !  the sound mixing is horrible ,  because sometimes the voices are disconnected .  it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80's the acting should have been better too well ,  to sum up ,  it's not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve !  in fact ,  it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years !  bad argument ,  bad acting ,  bad production i had no high hopes for this movie ,  but it was much worse than i've ever imagined !  just forget about it ! 
1	i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa .  they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court .  not ,  as it turned out ,  to protect the court members ,  but to protect him from the public .  this was fascinating ,  albeit morbid ,  reading .  i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case ,  but it was made for american tv .  bummed !  strangely ,  citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa .  i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket  ( i was alone ;  my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes )  .  wow !  what a brilliant film .  why wasn't it released to a wider audience ?  had it not been made for tv ,  it could have got an oscar nomination or 2 .  there is no way to spoil the ending ;  who the killer is is never kept from the audience .  jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho .  he is calm ,  downtrodden ,  considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work .  by committing these horrendous acts ,  he gets to feel strong ,  powerful .   fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist ,  played to excellent turn by stephen rea ,  in one of his strongest performances .  he must battle the snail-pace of russian bureaucracy ,  the primitive resources he has at his disposal and  ( above all )  the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer .  the general in charge  ( joss ackland )  says that serial killers are  " a decadent ,  western phenomenon "  .  only donald sutherland is willing to help ,  but his help must be under the counter .  the ever-brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest .  it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose ,  and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public .   citizen x is brilliantly acted ,  well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film .  excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing .  this was too good to be made for tv
0	so they hyped the violence and it's been branded as sick .  well ,  the violence is the best bit i'm afraid ,  but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their  ( entirely predictable )  rampage .  this film has a truly dreadful script .  we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic .  the acting isn't much better ,  either ,  the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher .  the direction is clumsy ,  the pace enough to send you to sleep .  and what on earth is the school film project all about ?  a comment on the film itself perhaps ?  the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable .  these guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth .  how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i'll never know .  and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery .  absolutely awful beyond comprehension . 
0	birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy ,  ,  is it a drama .  .  . it just doesn't know .  what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land .  the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out .  this is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine .  very disappointing . 
0	*warning* contains many spoilers !   let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script  ( or lack thereof .  )    the premise of the film was ,  in my opinion ,  a great idea and there were some genuinely thought-provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé .  it exemplifies why i hate 99% of british cinema .  it feels too long ,  it's tedious ,  for the most part ,  and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes .  just when you think there's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula radcliffe running a marathon .  with little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot ,  there isn't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn .  as for the script i can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees ,  with the average scene reading something along the lines of  " alice :  f*** off !   ( adam stares .  adam runs off into woods )  ( alice follows )  alice :  adam !  adam !  "  i suspect that ,  word for word ,  the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile adverts .  what few lines there were didn't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f-word that would make bridget jones's friend ,  shazza ,  proud .  there is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic 'oh that's terrible' reaction .   alice isn't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either .  she's got a great job ,  an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited ,  bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst .  after the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort-of explain why she is this way to start with ;  she grew up with a tough-as-old-boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so ,  instead of following in his footsteps ,  she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living .  instead she found a group of stereotypical middle-class toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security/entertainment system  ( i . e .  becoming mrs robinson to a wanna-be cockney wide-boy electrician )  someone pass me a tissue .  the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson .  in the hands of a lesser actress she would've been intolerably one-dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being ,  most notably when she's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault .   i can't say that adam fared much better either .  danny dyer played him well as a fish-out-of-water jack the lad but a good performance couldn't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background .    this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end .  as for the shock ,  the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin ms anderson has become ;  it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes .  on a side note ,  only in a british film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on - talk about stiff-upper-lip taken to the extreme !  if this is the kind of film that the national lottery is donating money to make then i'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week .    saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit ,  i didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion .  i want that one-and-a-bit hours of my life back ,  please ! 
0	this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original .  it's directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame .  the acting is very bad indeed ,  but the gore and special effects help make it interesting .  thats one thing i like about screaming mad george  ( make up effects artist for the film )  ,  his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get .  the movie isn't really all that gory ,  but there is an extremely nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot  ( what !  ?  !  )  mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time ,  possibly ?  if you liked the weirdo 4th installment  ( my favorite of all 5 )  ,  you'll probably like this one .  i liked it better than the matrix !  enjoy . 
1	this is a decent little flick made in michigan ,  about a guy that is haunted by his past ,  with his abusive stepfather  ( gunnar hansen )  and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted .  in fact ,  he's absolutely bonkers ,  but tries not to be too obvious .  he's got an entourage too ,  his own little demon & angel that follow him around .  the demon never says a word but really ,  doesn't have to ,  and he's max schreck-creepy .  let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this ,  as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better ,  like  " freeing "  people that he decides need it ,  mostly beautiful young women .  this is a decent portrayal of madness ,  and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on ,  but overall ,  i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest .  it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on .  a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks . 
0	prior to this release ,  neil labute had this to say about the 1973 original :   " it's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack .  i'm like ,  come on !  you may not like the new one ,  but if that's your favorite soundtrack ,  i don't know if i *want* you to like my film .  "    neil ,  a word .  you might want to sit down for this too ;  as lord summerisle says ,  shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent .  see ,  neil ,  the thing about the original ,  is that paul giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it .  the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical .  along with richard and danny thompson ,  and bert jansch ,  it practically kick-started the 1970s folk new wave .  to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams .  or the buddy holly story without buddy holly .  the result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant ,  pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallone's get carter .   the original had apparently left nicolas cage  " disturbed for about two weeks .  "  so disturbed ,  during that fortnight's window ,  that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism .  it's like some parlor game :  what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi ?  or gaspar  " irreversible "  noe remade love ,  actually ?  ( actually ,  i'd quite like to see that )  .  unfortunately ,  someone took this parlor game seriously :  all labute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupations .   after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash ,  cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor .  then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée willow woodward  ( this one trades on name-homages for kudos )  ,  now living on the private island community of summersisle  that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous'  and wants edward to help locate missing daughter rowan .   summersisle ,  it transpires ,  is a female-dominated joint ,  conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the salem witch trials .  here ,  the matriarchs observe the olde ways ,  and the few males are near-mute breed-mules .  it's like lilith fair on a grand scale .  summersisle's main export is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for edward ,  as he's allergic to bees .   " beekeepers !  "  cries edward .   " they seem to be everywhere on this island !  "  well ,  that's probably because summersisle's main export is honey .   while making his investigations ,  edward overhears of an oncoming mayday ritual called  " the time of death and rebirth "  .  he discovers the previous year's crop failed ;  nearly dies from bee stings ;  and eventually comes to the conclusion  ( a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands )  that rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest .  he also meets the queen bee of the hive ,  sister summersisle  ( burstyn )  ,  who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous wicker man :   " the drone must die .  "    first ,  the good news :  any concerns cage would be airlifted from the wicker man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia helicopters can be laid to rest :  he toast .  that's about it for the good news .   " this is a story whose chapters were carefully written "  intones burstyn with sublime irony .  though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise  ( and credits typography )  ,  what's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy .   crucial to shaffer's original screenplay was that his christian copper ,  in accordance with ritual ,  came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly ,  was a virgin ;  the perfect sacrifice .  in reducing matters to a sexual ,  as opposed to a religious power-struggle ,  labute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice .  by the time cage has worked out he was the bait ,  you honestly couldn't care less .   and cage is one of the very worst things in this ;  a lumbering ,  drawling donkey  an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth .   " goddamit "  he moans after he hallucinates a drowned rowan ,  with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early .  one hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state  alternately fatigued ,  then full of preppy ,  overbearing vim .  if so ,  it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished iq addled with anti-depressants .  if notit doesn't bear thinking about .  as willow ,  the saucer-eyed beahan is similarly dreadful ,  presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for themosthalf-hearteddelivery .  while burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince .  who's afraid of naomi wolf ?    every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs ,  the ingenious score ,  the dialogue  ( lord summerisle's majestic  " you did it beautifully !  "  has been replaced with the rather less attractive  " you did it excellently !  "  whoah ,  dude !  )   have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop .  namely ,  walloping women ;  this is a labute flick ,  after all .  cage's sister beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes ;  impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em ,  hyuk hyuk .   the closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché :  in a bar ,  two guys run into a couple of summersisle maidens on shore leave ,  flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs .  at the moment of their successful pick-up ,  you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera .   one more thing :  keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count  ( anything up to 10 )  tend to be not much cop .  the wicker man has 18 producers in total . 
1	i used to watch this show when i was a little girl .  although i don't remember much about it ,  i must say that it was a pretty good show .  also ,  i don't think i've seen every episode .  however ,  if you ask me ,  it was still a good show .  i vaguely remember the theme song .  everyone was ideally cast ,  the costume design was great .  the performances were top-grade ,  too .  i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode .  before i wrap this up ,  i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever ,  even though i don't think i've seen every episode .  now ,  in conclusion ,  when and if this show is ever brought back on the air ,  i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good . 
0	this fanciful horror flick has vincent price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another .  he devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him .  his master scheme seems to back fire on him .   price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces ,  but is still the only reason to watch this thriller .  supporting cast includes patrick o'neal ,  mary murphy ,  eva gabor and jay novello .   
0	this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced .  the insistent equation of jews with disease is simply  pathological ,  and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds  through its sheer repetition .  the fact that something this crude works ,  even  briefly ,  is an object lesson in itself .  you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this ,  and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason . 
0	i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i've gathered ,  it will be interesting  ( when i finally do read it and i will )  .  my comments will be based purely on the film .  as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did ,  i was so disappointed it hurt .  this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish .  the actors were not well cast  ( though robards and pryce are both good actors - just not here )  .  the kid actors ,  it seemed ,  were merely asked to show up ,  get in the characters' clothes ,  say the lines and make the faces .  the set and props were cheap and unrealistic .  the direction was surprisingly bad .  i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it ,  just to see the kind of work he had done .  the editing was cut and paste and the plot  ( screenplay )  was just that as well  ( even though the author had been involved himself ,  irony ?  )  .  the building up of the tension ,  fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came .   i've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it .  what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing .  it had so much potential .  unfortunately ,  the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story . 
1	the movie is just plain fun .  .  .  . maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of  " the ramones "  around the time the film was made .  i've watched the film over and over ,  by myself and with friends ,  and it is still fresh and funny .  at the risk of being too serious ,  the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless ,  and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless .   and ,  the film has some gem lines/scenes .  .  .  .  . references to how our  " permanent record "  in high school will follow us through life .   ( let me assure you i've been out of high school for ,  uhhh ,  some years and it's not following me )  .  .  .  .  . the famous  " static "  line  (  " i'm getting some static "  .  .  .  .  .  " not as much as you're going to get "  ,  as principal togar approaches )  .  .  .  .  . the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses .  .  .  . the nazi hall monitors love for a  " body search "   .  .  .  .  .  . principal togar announcing ,   " i give you the final solution "  ,  and burning the ramones records  ( note :  records were what came before cd's )   .  .  .  . and of course joey ramone noting ,   " things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school "  ,  followed by togar asking  " do your parents know you're ramones ?  "   just one piece of advice .  .  .  .  . don't look up where the stars are now .  .  .  .  . joey ramone sadly died young .  dey young ,  who was a major hottie in the film ,  today reminds us we all age .  .  .  . pj soles career never advanced as we might have expected .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  marla rosenfield ,  as one the other students ,  apparently appeared only in this film  ( one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film )  ,  though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles .  and ,  does anyone know what happened to dj don steele ?    so ,  watch and enjoy .  .  .  .  . don't think .  .  .  . just have fun ! 
1	of all arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man .  a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad .  it may have been far-fetched back then but not so now .  not when you think about it .  currently ,  reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar .  if the next one isn't more controversial as the last ,  it's a dud .  how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man ?  how long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the justice department ?  there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows .   the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to' .  it's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots .  and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe .  it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future .  it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic .  it's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see .  usually it's far from the real truth .   although rather different than stephen king's book  ( the ending is completely changed )  the script does conform to the typical arnie formula .  yes ,  he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'i'll be back'  ( which he never really said that often anyway ,  when you think about it )  in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been  ( these two were considered before arnie believe it or not )  .   the director is none other than dave starsky himself  ( paul michael glaser )  .  it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look .  andrew davis  ( not a director i particularly like )  was attached before glaser ,  though no matter who directs ,  the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel .   first of all ,  harold faltermeyer's score  ( remember him ?  )  is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity .  and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future .  apart from the dated feel ,  the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax .   this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release .  gone is the horrid letterbox picture .  in its place is a brand new hi-definition 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic transfer .  the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen .  the new dolby 5 . 1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing .  there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful .  definitely one of the best re-masters i've seen so far .  two intriguing documentaries ,  a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case . 
1	herbet clutter ,  wife bonnie ,  and their teenage children kenyon and nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of holcomb ,  kansas--but in the early hours of 14 november 1959 all four were brutally murdered .  rather unexpectedly ,  the crime made an impression on author truman capote ,  who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion .  the result was the book in cold blood .  controversial ,  shocking ,  and exceptionally well-written ,  it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day .   the 1967 film version of capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself .  filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations ,  it has a slightly documentary quality ,  icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional .  this is the film on which robert blake's reputation as an actor rests ,  and deservedly so .  as killer perry smith ,  blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy ;  it is a masterful performance from start to finish .  as richard hickock ,  scott wilson is no less fine .   like capote's book ,  the film opens with smith and hickock as they travel to kansas and brings them to the clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction .  the centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the clutter home ;  actually filmed in the clutter house itself ,  it is a spinechilling sequence ,  horrific and deeply disturbing .   director and writer richard brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation ,  erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy .  given the overall power of the film ,  however ,  this becomes a trivial annoyance .  strong stuff--and recommended .   gft ,  amazon reviewer
0	firstly , i must admit that it isn't a good movie .  and , i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it .   the movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours . and he is overworked , dizzy , sick and sometimes regretful . i don't like the character at all . it's really boring , after 20 minutes you may fall asleep . and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie . just because of money or what ?   since i'm an avid pacino fan , i bought this 2002 movie people i know . if you haven't bought it yet , don't even think about it , it's just a waste of time . 
1	let me get the bad out of the way first ,  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day .  really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes .  i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september 11th .  it is a second home to me and i can't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city .  this is the real deal ,  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them .  i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day .  it is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory ,  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way . 
0	i know it's a power-rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ?  if they are going to write a plot with crayons ,  at least have the decency to make it silly .  it's kind of hilarious if you watch this .  we have a typical family filled with cliched characters  ( father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol )  ,  air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting ,  and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space .  funny stuff !   however ,  the real great moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight ,  but then they realize none of them know how to  ( probably because no room in budget for choreographers )  ,  so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in .  lol .   1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously . 
0	- let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s .  i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously .  the problem i have is that none of it works .  a parody should be funny and this one just isn't .  not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile .  in general ,  i am easily entertained ,  but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures .   - i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning .  the two  " stars "  make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet .  these two come off as bowery boys wannabes .  why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me .  after the less than illustrious beginning ,  the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences ,  dancing indians ,  vegetable men ,  decoder rings ,  and other assorted unfunny bits .  it's all just a complete waste of time .   - i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls .  that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures . 
0	 " women ?  they're all scrubbers .  .  .  !  "    no ,  not a good translation ;  not at all !  this lags behind the previous year's  " dad's army "  ,  entirely missing the special ,  small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original ,  and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen .  .  .  you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline ,  and more precisely even than that ,  a *british film industry* entering decline .  and that is hardly a recommendation ,  is it ?  to be an exemplar of saddening folly .  .  .   all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been surgically stripped away ,  by cliff owen ,  galton and simpson are :  endless ,  dilapidated musical cues ,  yawn ,  from the ron grainer theme .  .  .  bolstered sentimentality  ( that shoddy ,  thick-eared ending .  .  .  how much bolder does the second steptoe film seem in comparison )  an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the 'misbegotten monstrosity'  ( yours truly on this site )  from 1973 ,   " the mutations "  .  there is a strangely botched ,  cut-adrift tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a rugby club ,  that i partly hate and recoil it  ( so far ,  as a friend intimated ,  from the mood of the tv series .  .  .  )  ,  but this at least seems an original slant ,  and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the britain of 1972 .  .  .  there is ,  however ,  an implied prostitute ,  aye of a 'heart-of-gold' who turns loose woman-traitor 'pon poor auld 'arold - and beyond-caricature writing of the 'class' element ;  not to mention ,  surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads .  brambell and corbett collude with the script ,  and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham .  what would anthony aloysius hancock have made of it all .  .  .  ?  i will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where g & s play things a little more carefully and b & c touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair .    but ,  and oh ,  how this pains me to say it :  it is tiresome ,  boring ,  both wilfully detached from reality and what made the tv series great ,  and also fully in tune with the lazy ,  tawdry ,  misogynist 'fuck it ,  that'll do .  .  . ' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film-making in the britain of the time . 
0	absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time !  it starts off badly and just deteriorates .  katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character .  the only cast-member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore ,  who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role .  the script is dire ,  the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through !  it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen !  katherine heigl's character is completely unsympathetic .  she's seen as an evil ,  wanton seductress who lures the poor ,  innocent married man to cheat on his wife .  it is implied throughout the movie that she's underage ,  and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief !  at the end ,  she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously  ( ha !  )  become demented with rage and guilt ,  but the script allows him to kill himself ,  thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere .  horrible .  don't waste your time . 
1	i saw this movie years ago on late night television .  back then it went by the title of  " stairway to heaven "  .  even as a young boy ,  i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial  ( those who have seen it know what i'm talking about )  .  such imagination !  a perfect blend of romance ,  drama ,  humour and fantasy ,  this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made :  citizen kane ,  casablanca ,  gone with the wind .  this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10 ;  over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10 .  i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen/rated this movie ,  compared to those on the list .  what a pity .  i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1  ( north america )  ,  so that 1 )  ,  i can purchase it ,  and 2 )  ,  others discover this hidden treasure . 
1	as part of our late 1950s vocabulary ,  we well knew the ponderosa ,  little joe ,  hoss ,  ben cartwright , etc .  on that great show  " bonanza .  "   it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set .  this was a real show depicting family values .  there may have been a weekly crisis ,  but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together .   lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family .  his words depicted wisdom .  we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright ,  a widower ,  must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died .  he reared wonderful sons .   naturally ,  we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show .  the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed .  his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son .  he should have tried to get back into the series .  he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out . 
1	there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first .  the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law :  anything that can go wrong ,  will go wrong .  this is exactly the case for dan burns  ( steve carell ,  the office )  a columnist for the local newspaper .  dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life ,  yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own .  dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy ,  tragedy ,  and beauty of them all .  besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious .   the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own .  .  .  each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life :  the first one anxious to try out her drivers license ,  the middle one well into her teenage angst phase ,  and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood .  things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore .   her name is marie  ( juliette binoche ,  chocolat )  and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations .  .  .  which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household .   if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine ,  you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well .  steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life :  the frustration and sincere compassion .  the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax .  the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes ,  yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability :  which is an irony within itself .   dan in real life is definitely worth seeing ,  for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life ,  and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time ,  or even a third .  just  " put it on my tab .  " 
0	for some reason ,  tv guide gave this two and a half stars ,  plus faye dunaway is in it ,  so it definitely looked like something to see .  my ,  oh ,  my ,  this may be the worst film i've ever seen .  ever .  from its horrid acting  ( every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him ,  i shouted to the tv  " i can't act !  "  when she asks what he needs ,  i yell  " i need acting lessons !  "  to the unbelievably bad dialog  (  " give me back my organs !  "  )  .   and the brian depalma wannabe ending ,  too ,  it was all just beyond awful .  i wanted to like it .  dunaway is one of the best actors ever .  and the production values were pretty good .   but wowzers ,  this had me laughing ,  laughing !  ,  most of the time .   don't even bother out of curiosity ,  that was my first mistake .  staying with it was definitely my second ,  and third and fourth . 
1	i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie .  some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action ,  some said it was too long ,  etc .  don't listen to them !  !  !  if you like shawshank redemption and/or braveheart ,  you will definitely love this movie !   the acting performances are superb !  tim roth ,  john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size .  the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking .  it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life  ( along with shawshank )  that was virtually flawless from casting ,  directing ,  writing ,  acting ,  etc .  !  !  !   i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed .  i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop .  i have seen this movie about 10 times  ( each time with a different person )  and everyone has loved it !  you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning .  if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site ,  than you will love this movie !  come on .  .  . all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at #32 ?  !  ?  !  that should show you the age range of most reviewers here !   this is a top 50 movie !  !  ! 
0	well ,  i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks .  it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family , then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie  , and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees ,  etc etc etc .  .  .  .  .  they go to that town which no one know it exists  ( blah blah blah )  and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that movie !  !  !  ! i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst ,  honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it . 
1	people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production .  i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd ,  and honestly its one of the best classes i've had ,  its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated .  i originally watched  " joy of life "  for another class where harry did a voice over in the film ,  and started watching this film after i started the class .  harry originally did some performance work ,  and is really genuine about creating moments that move you ,  especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment ,  but its something you see in this film . 
1	as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie .  it was the all round bollywood action/comedy movie .  it is a imitation of bad boys obviously !  the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing !  the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes .  the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed .  govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date ,  he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema .   the songs .  .  .  . the songs are both funny and catchy .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . proving laughs when you least expect it .  .  . amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah' .  .  .  . his accent .  .  . body language .  .  .  .  .  brilliant .  .  .   'assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . hilarious . 
1	it must have been several years after it was released ,  so don't know why it was at the movies .  but as a kid i enjoyed it .  i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again  ( it's been a lot of years )  .  i wasn't expecting much ,  now knowing how the b movies were made at that time .  but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding .  usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired .  surprisingly ,  the writing wasn't bad either .  forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning ,  because then the story would have ended ,  right ?  !  ok ,  the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary  ( they didn't even scare me as a kid )  .  however ,  making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes ,  it was a job well done by all .  i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns .  j .  farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count .  walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies .  did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong ?  did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as lisbeth searcy in old yeller ?  some of the mole men were famous too .  jerry maren has played mayor mccheese for mcdonalds ,  little oscar mayer ,  was the munchkin that handed dorothy the lollipop ,  was on a seifeld episode and a wealth of other work .  billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high plains drifter ,  was one of the friends met by the star in incredible shrinking man ,  he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal sal with rita hayworth ,  wizard of oz and plenty of other parts - great actor .  john brambury was also a munchkin .  phillis coates ,  who played lois lane in this movie ,  was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as superman/clark kent was superman .  he did a great job of playing the strong man .  bottom line to all i've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie .  but it was the 50's and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space .  it is definitely worth seeing ,  there isn't a bad actor in the group .  whomever put the cast together was very ,  very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film .  some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted .  so if you get a chance to see the film ,  forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting .  is it a bird ?  is it a plane ?  no ,  just a good ,  old fashioned movie to enjoy ! 
0	 ( there are spoilers )  homicidal nymphomaniac hooker miya ,  kari wuhrer , takes over the life and car of 18 virgin ,  even though he's too embarrassed to admit it ,  collage freshmen trent colbert ,  kristoffer ryan .  by the end of the movie myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him ,  or her , in order to keep from ending up turning into one .    hanging around a trucker rest-stop miya is picked up by roy ,  burt young ,  for some hot and heavy action ,  in the back seat of his buggy .  roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that miya is non other then his estranged daughter !  outraged that miya is reluctant to get it on with him roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student trent colbert who plows into the rest-area side swiping one of the truckers .    seeing her chance miya jumps into trent's car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie .  going all across the north eastern usa the two end up involved in a truck car smash-up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to trent's parents home ,  with them being held hostage .  it's there that there's another wild shootout between the crazed miya with an entire swat team reinforced by the local police and state troopers .    you would expect a movie like  " hit and run "  to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it's not .  in fact the film is very disturbing in how miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-molesting father roy .  getting trent to drive her all over the north-east miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room ,  together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle .  miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny mr .  foster by tricking him into giving her his gun ,  as being part of some weird sex game .  after holding foster up she takes off with trent's ,  who out cold in his motel room ,  wallet with some $400 . 00 in it yet doesn't bother to drive away with his car .    needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for thanksgiving trent gets a call on his cellphone from miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back .  like the jerk that he is trent picks up miya ,  who's now a fugitive from he law ,  and later gets involved with her father roy on the open highway as he tries to run both trent & miya off the road .    the chase ends up in this deserted wear-house that roy chases miya , out running him on a muddy road in high-heels ,  into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun .  roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended .    with both a holdup and murder ,  as well as a hit and run ,  charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a s&m/tattoo boutique where trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains ,  by myri ,  together with a matching his and hers dog collar .  this in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for thanksgiving dinner .    having a running shootout with the state troopers ,  with one of them ending up badly injured , the two fugitives from the law end up at trent's parents mr & mrs colbet ,  david keith & elaine martyn home with the entire local police force ,  with a swat team ,  waiting for them there .    obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying , if at all ,  to tell it's audience .  you felt a lot of sympathy for miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it's downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in death valley .  even though roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended miya totally eclipsed him . 
0	if they gave me the option of negative numbers i'd use it .  this movie was truly god-awful .  i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible ,  and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations .   the script was weak ,  the acting was painful .  i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth ,  i think we were both disappointed .   the growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong .  eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain ,  he came off as oddly weak and silly .  jenny johnsons  ( uma thurman )  came off as psychotic and strange ,  as did matt's  ( luke wilson )  friend vaughn  ( rainn wilson . 
0	everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful .  i wasn't going to comment ,  but the film just bugs me so much ,  and the writer/director in particular .  so i must toss in my hat to join the naysayers .   i saw the original  " wicker man "  and really loved the cornucopia of music ,  sensuality ,  paganism in a modern world ,  and the clash of theological beliefs .  this said ,  i am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done .  for example ,  i liked the original 1950's  " invasion of the body snatchers "  ,  but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake .  both films can stand on their own .  another example is  " the thing "  .  the original ,  as campy as it looks compared to today's standards ,  has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with kurt russell  ( my all time favorite horror movie )  .  so that small minority of people who like  " the wicker man "  re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make .   this film solidified for me neil labute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies .  it also made me wonder how executives ,  wanting to make a serious thriller ,  would green light a product that is so anti-female .  there are too many scenes of cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl .  would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming ?  the original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a goddess based religion .  the threat to the main character came from everyone ,  male and female .  there was no sexual hierarchy .   the metaphor of bees ,  drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient  (  " the drone must die !  "  )  ,  especially when cage's character has bee allergies .  i kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts .  these were not women with special supernatural powers ,  and half of them seemed to be pregnant ,  the other half old and fat ,  and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs ,  so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women .  physically dominate them .  there didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy .  but if they were content being drones ,  why make them unable to speak ?  they could be used as a threat to cage because they will defend the community .  they are drones because neil labute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated .   ( that movie was made already .   " the stepford wives "  anyone ?  )  classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens .   the problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when cage starts knocking women out .  i belief labute should've left the society an egalitarian one ,  kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness ,  and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island .  no one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited .  so how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around ?  there would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused ,  thus ,  an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children .  labute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give cage's character an incentive to search .  i don't think you need that .  any child abused will make an adult react to save them .  the irony of course would be that the child cage  " saves "  ultimately brings him death .   the dialogue was contrived and campy .  the whole third act was hilarious .  the audience i saw it with guffawed  ( and later booed at the end )  .  i just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded cage is .  we don't need that .  just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child .  most of us in america have seen  " law & order "  and other cop procedurals .  we come into the movie as if we are cage's partner solving a mystery .   so much potential .  .  . wasted .  neil labute ,  stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort .  stay with your own company of men .  leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers .  here is your jar of honey .  i'll watch that . 
0	creepshow 2 is the ill-fated sequel to the george romero's  ( overrated )  original ,  creepshow .  any sequel following a romero film that's not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill ,  mostly because of the romero fans out there who think he's god .  i didn't care much for the first film and funny enough ,  i didn't care much for the sequel .  the film series had so much potential but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar .    the biggest problem with creepshow 2 was that it only had three stories  ( excluding the in-between story )  ,  and because the first story sucked beyond belief ,  it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be *really* good .  i saw cs 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner .  anything dramatic with george 'i can't act' kennedy is automatically doomed and the indian statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel .  so after a really trite and dull start ,  there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story .  the raft and the hitchhiker are moderately successful ,  moderately because though the two other segments have their moments ,  they still sorta fall flat .  the two last stories are basically stretched out for too long .  it's not that i wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast ,  but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized ,  more erratic and with punchier endings .  also ,  if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction ,  they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch .  having only three padded segments made for a boring feast .   the acting and writing in both the raft and the hitchhiker segments are from awful to good .  i like lois chiles in the last segment .  it's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as bond girl holly goodhead in moonraker and in death on the nile .  but even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story .  are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her ?  are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker ?  if the hitchhiker's body was found by other people on the road ,  what was he when he attacked chiles ?  was he a ghost or a zombie or what ?  how did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack chiles ?  the whole thing is not very clear ,  even for a supernatural story .  and the ending is rather dull and uneventful .   as for the infamous the raft story ,  well ,  the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting .  the characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves .  none of the actors are convincing in their specific roles .  paul satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut .  she seems too timid .  the same could be said with the two others who play the  " plain "  teens .  the idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed .  there should have been a fifth character to the story ,  maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster's alter ego of sorts .  as creepy as the oil slick is ,  it doesn't make for a compelling  " character "  .  and the way the story ends ,  everything seems pointless .  no punch to it whatsoever .   except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile ,  seeing creepshow 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time .  cs 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen . 
1	a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend .  of course the sob is very good-looking ,  charming ,  etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman .  watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends .  it's tragic ,  and you know she's going to end up very hurt ,  but there's nothing you can do .  leaud is brilliant .  totally empty .  a blank throughout ,  he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants .   the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love ,  and the next morning he puts on a record and ,  very sweetly and charmingly ,  sings along to amuse her is brilliant .  the  " what the hell am i doing here with this idiot "  expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come .   it's a long film ,  but see it in one go ,  preferably in a cinema .  takes a while to get into ,  but then the time just disappears . 
1	lindy  ( meryl streep )  and her husband michael  ( sam neill )  have just welcomed a baby girl ,  azaria .  as seventh day adventists ,  they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church ,  with their two older boys looking on .  michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer's rock ,  one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia .  not being wealthy ,  the family camps near the site .  after a wonderful first day ,  lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents .  suddenly ,  she hears azaria crying .  as lindy rushes to the tent ,  a dingo dog is just exiting ,  shaking his head .  the baby is gone and soon ,  so is the dingo .  although the entire camp looks for the baby ,  she is not found .  concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child ,  the chamberlains struggle to accept god's decision and go on with their lives .  but ,  unfortunately ,  the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby .  she is subsequently arrested and put on trial .  how could this happen ?  this is a great depiction of real events that shows how  " mob rule "  is not a figment of the imagination .  the entire country turns against the chamberlains ,  in part because they are seen as odd .  streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy ,  whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way .  neill ,  likewise ,  does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael .  the cast is one of the largest ever ,  with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy's case .  the costumes ,  scenery ,  script ,  direction and production are all top of the line .  if you have never seen or heard of this film ,  remedy that straight away .  it is not a far cry from reality to say that this  " cry "  should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media . 
1	sure ,  he became rapidly uneven after this film ,  but from  " knife in the water "  up till  " the tenant "  ,  roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique .  despite many running themes  ( alienation ,  paranoia )  ,  no two of his films are really alike .  the story of this is somewhat similar to his own  " repulsion "  from ten years earlier ,  but the tone is completely different .   " the tenant "  manages to balance darker than dark absurdity  ( i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor ,  even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny )  with some truly suspenseful paranoia .  polanski was always a master at building unease ,  and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy .  the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus .   in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction ,  the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions .  polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director ,  but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast .  the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange .  the rest of the cast offers strong performances also ,  especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn ,  and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones .   " the tenant "  is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both  " repulsion "  and  " rosemary's baby "  ,  but its just as brilliant as either of those classics .   ( 9/10 ) 
0	this movie was so bad !  it was terrible !  it was awful !  i cannot stress it enough !  the acting ,  directing ,  story ,  characters and everything about it was bad !  it was so corny and clichéd .  don't be fooled by the cover ,  or the tag line  " the 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at .  "  are you frogging' kidding me !  it was ridiculous .   the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan ,  ok now turn it off .  what i got from the film was ,  a bunch of ugly ,  annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways .   this movie was a waste of my time and money ,  and it would be a waste of your money and time too !  i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible ,  i just wanted to see how each bad actor died ,  and it still wasn't worth it !  just looking at the cover is a waste of time .  this is seriously the worst movie ever !  rating :  doesn't deserve one . 
0	this was longer than the ten commandments ,  all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined .  my oh my ,  what a nightmare .  this is the single biggest over-hype of 2006 .  there is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd .  movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer .  dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture ,  in the form of endless music montages ,  shoddy acting ,  and poor directing choices  ( seriously ,  mr .  condon ,  did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots ?  it's at #58 !  no wait ,  look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again .  .  .  . and again .  .  .  . and again ) 
0	i didn't know what to expect from the film .  well ,  now i know .  this was a truly awful film .  the screenplay ,  directing and acting were equally bad .  the story was silly and stupid .  the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film ,  but he didn't .  i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad .  where was the focus to the film ?  where was anything in this film ?  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it .  it was shabbily done and a waste of my money .  do not see this film . 
1	turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget .  the variety of characters is amazing ,  from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls !  i enjoyed the relationship between the leads ,  not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going .  i also enjoyed the mix of humour  ( which can be very easy to get wrong ,  too much/not enough )  which meant it didn't get too dark ,  nor too spoofy .  it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts ,  hellbreeder and sanitarium ,  in terms of storyline and production .  they have a great website which is worth checking out .  can't wait for bane ,  if the level of improvement continues ,  it should be fantastic . 
0	any movie with  " national lampoon "  in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london , england , paris , france , rome , italy , and anywhere in germany . it may be an institution in the u . s .  but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience .  " national lampoon's european vacation "  is unlikely to rectify that situation .  the appalling griswalds are just that - appalling . they are not funny .  clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny ,  after all miss b . di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes , but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out £2 . 50 for the privilege .  the section set in england is typical . the same old same old tv performers ,  messrs idle , smith , coltrane , miss m . lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés , mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor .  .  .  . yawn , yawn , yawn .  .  bucking - ham palace , big ben .  .  .  .  .  . i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren , need i go on ?  the english are buffoons , the french vicious - tongued yank-haters . the germans pompous and puffed up ,  ( don't mention the war , clark )  , and the italians lecherous bottom-pinchers . have i forgotten anything ?  every possible  " comic "  situation is worked to death , mr chase gurns desperately , miss di angelo dimples sweetly , the children are embarrassingly bad .  the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste . 
0	first ,  let me just comment on what i liked about the movie .  the special effects were fantastic ,  and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game .  there ,  that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film .  in fact ,  i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing .    i have innumerable complaints about the film ,  but four major complaints jump to mind .  my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the  " plot twist "   ( if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away )  where lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of superman .  when the crying super-child throws a piano at lex's henchman to save his mother ,  i almost got up and left the theater .  singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child .  it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit .    my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space .  it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that .  i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read ,  but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet .  whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman-related projects ever again .  the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun .  why not just have superman eat kryptonite ?  he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it ,  and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas .  that's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground .    my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie .  i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god-like jor-el sent to earth to be a savior .  jor-el wasn't all-wise ,  he was just a scientist .  and he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior ,  he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode .  i'll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode ,  and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ's primary weakness .  furthermore ,  the  " crucifixion "  scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite  " spear "  just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future .  they might as well rename this movie  " superman returns :  the passion of the christ .  "   and speaking of luthor ,  my last major complaint has to do with singer's depiction of lex luthor .  lex luthor is a shrewd ,  cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president  ( which he does in the comics )  than try to destroy the world .  the man wants money and power ;  he wants to be in charge ,  not wreck everything .  yet the luthor we see superman returns ,  as well as all the previous superman movies ,  is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world .  if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the  ( quite awful )  previous superman movies ,  this film might not be such an unbearable travesty .  maybe singer's next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show .  zam !  whap !  pow !  !   to summarize ,  i don't know what i hate more ,  the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews .  everyone is entitled to their opinion ,  but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong .  i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already .  don't see it ,  don't buy it when it comes out on dvd ,  don't rent it .  .  . basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way .  this movie does not deserve to make any money .  in fact ,  i think that for every person that sees this movie ,  bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars .  if you're a superman fan and you really want to see this movie ,  just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time . 
1	this film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in austria .  it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples .  it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others .   in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film .  and rightly so .  because the film is not and easy one to watch .  it has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film .  it is a very cruel movie ,  not for everyone's taste .  you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film .  it grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity .   i can not  " recommend "  or  " not recommend "  this film .  you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier .  just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone's taste . 
0	one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a  script existed that made any sense .  was the rough cut 3 hours  long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives ?    why would anyone finance this mess ?  i will say that tom  wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can  with the dialogue and dramatic  (  ?  )  situations he is given .  but  characters come and go for no apparent reason ,  continuity is  non-existent ,  and the acting ,  cinematography ,  and direction are  ( to  put it politely )  amateurish .  not one sleeps is an unfortunate  choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone  actually attempt to actually watch this film . 
0	whoa boy .   ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him ?  well they exist ,  in many forms .  but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone's praises about how much of an artistic  " genius "  he is ?  well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene  ( i know they're everywhere and i don't even follow the local scene )  ,  or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe .   the premise is good and ,  honestly ,  it's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary .  we are made to follow two bands ,  the brian jamestown massacre ,  lead by anton ,  and the dandy warhols ,  lead by courtney .  i've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie .  .  .  not so the brian jamestown massacre .  why ?  well from this documentary's perspective ,  because the brian jamestown massacre's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry .  however ,  instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed ,  the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity .   because ,  see ,  anton is a  " genius .  "  because he plays rock music .  he really  " understands the evolution of music "  .  .  .  because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments .  his music is considered  " post-modern retro but the future "  .  .  .  because it's rock music .  he wants to bring out a  " revolution "  .  .  .  through rock music .  okay so let's face it .  .  .  twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i'd care to watch a documentary about .   the documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to showcasing any of anton's talent ,  because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that .  so instead we watch anton ,   " the genius "  ,  the socio-maniacal loser ,  be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music .  whether he did or not i won't know ,  because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it .  what i do know is that then we're left with a story about some self-centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up .  why even bother watching that ?  people like anton don't deserve the attention they seek ,  the hope and admiration of all those different people ,  and especially a post-failure paean to lost potential .  this movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut vh1 special for a reason :  he goes on and on about the music ,  but it's all about the image and the attention .  look at the guy ,  look at how he dresses ,  look at how he acts ,  look at how he tries to create controversy because he can't afford marketing .   honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel ,  and that's because of anyone in this documentary ,  joel is the only person who seems to have any fun .  maybe it's because he's the tambourine man .  the rest of them are all  " rock stars "  !  they deserve our attention ,  and admiration ,  and interest ,  and engagements !  they are out there to  " save rock and roll .  "  do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to  " save rock and roll "  ?  yeah ,  that was because of anton ,  and it's  " selfish of them not to mention me  ( anton )  as an inspiration .  "  what a load .  people like anton are best left forgotten .  this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull--because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless .  thanks a lot ,  anton .  your antics ruined music for everyone you touched ,  whatever the opinion to the contrary is .  and if people  " in the know "  about anton disagree and he really was a genius ,  it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way .   --polarisdib
0	two old men sitting on a park bench  .  i don`t really have a problem with this scene - only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie  yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this  .  they also don`t get anymore boring than this either  ,  but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese  .  one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black  .  let me see now  ,  a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine  .  well i guess it`s possible though unlikely  ,  but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype  ?  why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths  ?  slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930s  stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with i`m not rappaport is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema  ,  it`s based on a stage play and it shows  .  walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
0	are we talking about the same movie ?  this movie is totally ridiculous ,  the plot is disgusting and completely without logic .  its a typical straight to dvd/tv-movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience :  over-acting by has been actors ,  side steps from the plot that are left unexplained ,  the girl shows her t*ts ( why ,  god ,  why ?  ?  )  ,  people do not react to things as they would in real life .  i'm not even gonna bother you with details ,  it would take all night .  well ,  ok ,  just one :  if two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street ,  one of the victims practically dies in your arms ,  his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you ,  would your first concern be ;   " oh ,  he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face !  "  ?  my thoughts goes to harvey and his lost career . 
1	again ,  it seems totally illogical ,  to me at least ,  that  " arthur "  merits a mere 6 . 4 out of 10 possible .  steve gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally  " unlikely "  if not quite  " impossible "  melding of wildly disparate elements .  that he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is ,  in itself ,  wonderful .  that he gave dudley moore his finest role ,  and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact ,  including the score ,  seems to me patent and egregious .  i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud .  but ,  apparently ,  nearly a third of its audience has so managed .  well ,  i ,  for one ,  found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable ,  and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great-aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters .  even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization ,  and the late ,  sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee ,  but wrong about undertaking his role .   " arthur "  makes no effort to  " underztand ,  "  much less rationalize ,  the scourge of  " alcoholism "   ( hey ,  ifit ain't booze ,  it's other drugs of choice ,  including meth ,  and addictions are merely symptoms ,  not targets )  ,  it simply observes in its own quizzical manner . 
1	in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv .  dietrich bonhoeffer's life ,  is a true example about a good german and specially ,  about a good man .  the conversations between tukur's character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting .  a true ideas' war :  two different germans ,  both with faith in there believes .  bonhoeffer was a very complex person :  man ,  freedom fighter ,  boyfriend ,  churchman and a great intellectual ;  ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer .  i recommended this film a lot ,  specially in this difficult times for the planet .  in mexico we don't know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy ,  this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero . 
1	i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out .  i was thinking how dumb is disney getting .  i was wrong .  i found it to be very good .  i mean it's not the lion king but it's cool to see another side from a certain point .  it was very funny .  also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks ,  it was just like the lion king animation .  the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie .  not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about .  i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return .  it was a very good movie over all . 
1	for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time .  no exceptions .  james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller .  through films such as aliens ,  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes .  he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film .  but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance .  the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises ,  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows .  the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful ,  interesting and entertaining film about it .  the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  ( gloria stuart )  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone ,  no one else .  emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home .  the music has become iconic and legendary .  it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience .  the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is .  only one problem ,  the usual james cameron problem ,  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside .  james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime .  my heart won't go on from this one . 
0	well ,  this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated .  i thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-disney channel type mode ,  especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long .  alana de la garza is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent .  the movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget .  there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner .  the laughs are very few and far between .  the end surprise for  " mr .  fix it "  is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else .  might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or tv but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie . 
0	i saw this movie a long time ago .  .  .  luckily it was for free .  i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater .  i don't remember a whole bunch of it ,  but i do remember i was incredibly bored ,  the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was .  i just was incredibly bothered by one thing :  if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive ,  why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty ?  how stupid do they think we are ? 
1	i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work ,  honestly .  some people were looking for a plot ?  ?  ?  ok ,  when this video came out over a decade ago ,  i watched it for what it was :  a collection of music videos .  it's not a movie .  it doesn't have a plot ,  nor a central storyline .  it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos ,  all of them rather smartly or creatively done .  michael jackson may be considered a freak these days ,  but ,  after all ,  this was the man who gave us thriller  ( considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time )  and set trends with billie jean and beat it .  with moonwalker ,  he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff ,  incorporating claymation ,  special effects ,  live performance footage ,  and even self-parody  ( the  " badder "  sequence )  .  and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there ,  this video came out just a tad before he became a household name ,  and was one of his most memorable appearances on film .  and ,  imho ,  i think the smooth criminal sequence  ( the choreographed section )  beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point ! 
0	how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film .  tina still looked fit and attractive ,  but for some reason seems truly frightened .  i can understand her fear ;  fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public .  also ,  i'm a fan of the likable adam west .  again ,  as with tina ,  adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age .  his acting here is passable ,  but the script is so bad ,  that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog .   the movie is a rip-off of the classic brando biker flick ,  the wild ones ;  out-law biker gang is out-of-control in a small hick-town .  the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister .  the acting is stiff and wooden ,  and the story-plot is as old as sand .  hellriders is hell to watch ! 
0	wendy wu :  homecoming warrior has a very good ,  strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie .  i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much .  i thought the effects were horrible ,  but they might seem entertaining to younger children .  the matrix moves ruined the action ,  you know that it was absolutely fake .  then there was the yen lo ,  an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win .  it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo  ( and destroy him forever )  in the end .  so wendy learns a lesson .  .  . blah ,  blah ,  blah .  i'm ready for the next dcom . 
0	the second half of steven soderbergh's revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia .  in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure  (  " this is the history of a failure "  he writes in the preface of his congo journal )  to concentrate fully on che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia .  it would turn out to be a disaster and guevara's final act .   what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro .  the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle .  unlike werner herzog in the magnificent ,  aguirre ,  the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas .  he seems more concerned with keeping che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders .  there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderbergh's mise en scene remains flat ,  sloppy and uninteresting .    in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow .  he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga ,  especially fidel castro .  making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire .  one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style . 
1	i miss dark angel !  .  .   i understand not ever one likes it ,  but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled ,  especially for another space show mock up .  .  .   i'm reading the books now .  they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings ,  but i still think we should get a tv movie or something .   the freak nation lives !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
0	argh !  this film hurts my head .  and not in a good way .   maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre ,  but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals ,  i still regarded this film with dislike .  now i utterly despise it .   take one fairly good fast-paced story .  keep the title and throw the rest away .  instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing  ( why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena ,  what about the cameras ?  why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room ?  )   the whole film screams eighties ,  from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes .  ugh .   don't watch this film .  i know some people liked it ,  but some people get off on being peed on and i don't understand them either . 
0	i had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes ,  and that is exactly what i was .   of course it is campy ,  of course some of the dialog wasn't perfect ,  of course the  " special effects "  were a bit hokey .  that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much .  it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70's horror classic .   the talent needs to start some where ,  that goes for the actors and the crew ,  and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than this .   i for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors . 
0	i have been searching for the right words to describe this film .  at first i was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters ,  as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment .   yet ,  i stopped ,  puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question :   " what can one say about such a film ?  "  rubbish ?  no ,  its not rubbish ,  rubbish can be recycled into something useful .  greenhouse gas ?  no ,  its not greenhouse gas ,  greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy .   finally ,  i struck on  " not even bad ,  "  a rework of the phrase  " not even wrong "  used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction .  that's it then ,  georgia rule :  not even bad . 
1	this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre .  i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba .  he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption .  isn't this a rather consoling thought ?   when i watched it for the first time ,  i thought that after the won election ,  the movie would be over - i didn't know the book .  so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come !  i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film .   many people here utterly dislike this movie .  i cannot understand that one single bit .  maybe those who read the book first are - as often with screen adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold ,  unseen ,  unexplained .  but as a movie telling a touching story - the story of a family ,  the rise and fall of a man ,  the deep compassion of a woman ,  the strength of love and the insanity of hate  ( and conservatism )  - this movie is simply splendid !  furthermore ,  the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well - especially winona ryder and jeremy irons .   so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for ! 
1	i was pretty surprised with this flick .  even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good .  the acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me .  my only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste .  but hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded .   i would really recommend anyone in hollywood to look up antonella ríos who is an excellent spanish talent  ( something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting )  .  antonella ríos truly is a star on the rise . 
0	i don't really know where to start .  the acting in this movie was really terrible ,  i can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act .  not only the acting was bad ,  the characters were incredibly stupid as well .   then there's the action .  i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot ,  there's blood involved .  but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten  (  !  !  )  times ,  there's no blood at all .  well ,  i guess that's just me .   to make a long story short  ( because believe me ,  i can go on for hours about this film )  ,  this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw .  this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt . 
0	the robin cook novel  " coma "  had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978 .  a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment  ,  but in the case of  " sphinx "  virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong .  this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances ,  stupid dialogue ,  unconvincing characters and leaden pacing .  the only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself .  hard to believe franklin j .  schaffner  ( of  " patton "  and  " planet of the apes "  )  is the director behind this debacle .   pretty egyptologist erica baron  ( lesley anne-down )  is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu-hamdi  ( john gielgud )  .  hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge .  consequently ,  he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop .  the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica ,  for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i's long-lost tomb ,  a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 .  before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop ,  with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end .  afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen ,  erica attempts to track down the treasure .  she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties ,  none of whom are truly trustworthy .  for one there is yvon  ( maurice ronet )  ,  seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives ?  then there is akmed khazzan  ( frank langella )  ,  an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her .   the biggest problems with  " sphinx "  generally result from its total disregard for plausibility .  down couldn't be less convincing as a female egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite well-educated and resourceful ,  yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick .  on those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain ,  she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4 , 000 year old tomb !  the plot twists are heavy-handed to say the least ,  mainly comprising of revelations and double-crosses that can be predicted well in advance .  one can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare ,  because the pacing is awfully sluggish .  what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium .  a famous review of the movie declared :   " sphinx stinks !  "  never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words . 
0	this movie was terrible to say the least .  i was hoping for a lot better after seeing  " high school musical "  .  the whole entire movie was a complete rip off of  " the simple life "  ,  only it wasn't a reality show .   the acting was not good at all .  amanda michalka had her moments ,  when she wasn't that terrible .  on the other hand alyson michalka was bad all the way through .  chris gallinger ,  who played the love interest of amanda was playing a french guy ,  but had an awful accent .  one good thing about this movie was the completely adorable michael trevino ,  who played alyson's love interest .  just something to keep in mind ,  if this movie had been aired before  " high school musical "  it probably would not have seemed as bad .  but it was no comparison .   overall i give it a 2 . 
0	i watched this film in youth group ,  where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it .  then some adult couple at a church-related christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance ,  and now my household is stuck with the film  ( though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap )  .  i cried bitter tears over these sad events ,  and here's why :  first off :  this film has good intentions ,  especially if you're a christian like me .  this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that it'll make your life better .  not so bad ,  right ?  eh .  it turns out a be a problem--a big one .  this movie was made by a church ,  so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for christians as possible .  it is all black-and-white ,  no gray areas .  god's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing ,  and it comes instantly to all those who do his bidding .   this is not the god i know .  this is not the christian life i am familiar with .  the god i believe in is a powerful and trustworthy god ,  but he is not one that grants my every wish .  i follow him as best i can ,  though the going is often hard ;  yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self-control a lot easier than anyone should ever find it .  i cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad-side to good-side in the course of a few structured movie scenes .  and when i do follow his commandments as laid out in the bible ,  i certainly don't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do .  the largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that i have done the right thing ;  everything else comes with long ,  messy ,  arduous work .   but take the example this movie sets :  grant taylor coaches the football team at shiloh christian school ,  which has had 6 losing seasons in a row .  he may lose his job over it ,  and he and his wife are low on money as it is .  they want a baby ,  but the doctor tells him he is sterile .  oh ,  and his car doesn't work .  and the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents ,  whiny after their million losses ,  and bad at kicking field goals .  this is sure one rundown community here .   but wait ,  grant taylor decides he's going to trust in god for everything !  and he passes on his faith to his team .  so far ,  so good .  not for long .  as they begin to obey ,  blessing literally pour in on them .  suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents ;  the school has a big  " revival "  ;  the team starts winning every game ;  they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league !  coach taylor's job is reassured ;  the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present  ( which ,  by the way ,  is the epitome of shallow ,  fair-weather employers )  ;  he gets a raise ;  his wife  ( get this )  even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm !  and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters !  !  wowzers ,  woot ,  yay ,  praise the lord ,  etcetera ,  etcetera !  !  !   .  .  .   yipe .  just yipe .  nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cut-and-dry manner .  yes ,  there have been miracles aplenty in my family ,  as well as gifts and creature comforts ,  and i attribute them to god's grace and lovingkindness .  but god isn't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad !  he is by and large a mystery ;  his gifts come unexpectedly ,  often when you think you don't need them but you really do .  it's a long ,  hard slog to the road of fulfillment ,  and things never turn out the way you thought they would .   this movie has good intentions .  but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism ,  it tanks tremendously to a 1/10 .  the bad acting and sports movie clichés seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes .   to all you future churches planning to make a movie :  don't be afraid to show real life ,  even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix .  however much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat ,  nobody has learned anything substantial from it .  give us the meat ,  the bones ,  the real stuff !  true life applies to everyone ,  not just christians ,  and that's one aspect  " facing the giants "  didn't manage to grasp . 
0	we saw this on the shelf at the local video store ,  saw  " coppola "  in the credits and got excited .  that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest .  i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably ,  or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably .  in general ,  the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish .  the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful ,  especially in the scenes shot in the little bar ;  the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable .  very disappointing . 
1	this is the final episode we deserved .  at the end of the last season ,  things were left in a 'life goes on' mood ,  which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved .  while not a happy show ,  this series was always one that made you think  ( a rare thing on television )  ,  and this is no exception .  'is death justified by reasoning ? ' 'are morals reflective of society ,  or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' 'what is a just death ,  and can it exist ? ' all of these questions ,  and more ,  are posed by the writers of this show every week ,  and this is their final thesis .  fine acting ,  great writing ,  wonderful camera-work ,  brilliant editing ,  clean direction .  if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran ,  then get a hold on a copy somehow .  if you never watched the series when it ran ,  then this will stand up on its own ,  but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts .  for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons ,  this is very satisfying viewing . 
1	anyone interested in pop music ,  and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies ,  should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once .  the movie ,  about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world ,  captures the times perfectly ,  from the overt sexism ,  rough economic times ,  social upheaval ,  to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism/new romanticism .  the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled  ( there really has been nothing new since 1980 )  .  this was a dazzling time ,  and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape ,  and does both extremely well . 
1	don't get me wrong .   " goldeneye "  was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise .  but the series had fallen into a fps rut .  enter  " everything or nothing "  ,  which puts bond in third-person .  when i wrote my earlier review for  " from russia with love "  ,  i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly .  even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise ,  eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety .  missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv ,  driving an aston martin ,  driving a limousine that is wired to explode ,  commandeering two different types of tanks a la  " goldeneye "  ,  riding a motorcycle ,  flying a helicopter ,  repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires ,  and free falling after a plummeting damsel .  sure ,  vehicle controls are a little clumsy ,  but the issue here is the variety .   as movie adaptations ,   " goldeneye "  and frwl were all that i could have hoped for .  but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure .  this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe ,  shannon elizabeth ,  heidi klum ,  and misaki ito .  judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q ,  respectively ,  and pierce brosnan ,  while no sean connery ,  adds credibility to the game's proceedings .  all characters resemble the stars ,  with the disappointing exception of heidi klum ,  who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice .  mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes .   the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies .  willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from  " a view to a kill "  .  richard kiel appears as jaws ,  the hulking henchman from  " the spy who loved me "  and  " moonraker "  in three fight scenes ,  the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have .   single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond .  like bond ,  you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing .  the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth ,  with plenty of wall and object cover .  unfortunately ,  unlike frwl ,  only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging ,  so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner ,  and vice-versa .  the game also allows players to go into  " bond reflex "  mode .  while you browse your inventory ,  everything around you will go into super slo-mo ,  allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with .  while this takes some getting used to ,  eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular  " bond moments "  ,  such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath ,  and greatly add to the bond movie feeling .   there are 3 available difficulty levels :  operative ,  agent ,  and double oh .  on operative ,  you can breeze through in a few hours .  on agent ,  a few weeks .  on double oh ,  a few months .  the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission .  garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear .  some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints ,  but when all is said and done ,  no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie .   multi-player ,  unfortunately ,  is not as thrilling .   " goldeneye "  still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game .  eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's .  a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode .  but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date .  the ending ,  as with most bond games ,  is anticlimactic .  while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game ,  the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing .  also ,  levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error .  still ,  for any serious bond fan ,  not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films . 
0	this film has an interesting plot ,  but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor .  i was very disappointed .  the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one ,  but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered .  2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was .  i stuck it out to the end ,  but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable . 
1	 " the gingerbread man is the first thriller i've ever done !  "   robert altman   in 1955 charles laughton directed  " the night of the hunter "  ,  a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer .  one of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat ,  the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster .    seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in  " cape fear "  ,  another film set in the american south .  that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat .  in 1991 martin scorsese ,  trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream ,  remade  " cape fear "  ,  boat scene and all .   now we have robert altman's  " the gingerbread man "  ,  another slice of small town southern gothic .  altman says he consulted  " the night of the hunter "  for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to  " spread his wings and try a popcorn picture "  ,  but what he's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre .   so instead of a showdown on small boat ,  we get a showdown on a giant ship .  instead of two kids being kidnapped ,  we get two kids being safely returned to the police .  instead of money being hidden ,  we have money being readily given via a last will and testament .  instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake ,  we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh .  instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys .  instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat ,  we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster's  " house ship "  .  similarly ,  instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall .   .   . etc etc etc .   altman goes on and on ,  reversing everything just a little slightly ,  pulling at the edges and doing his own thing .  his touch is most apparent during the film's first half-hour ,  the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot-driven movie storytelling and altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue ,  casual narratives ,  prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on .   still ,  despite altman's best intentions ,  the film never rises above mediocrity .  altman's too bound to the conventions of the  " thriller format "  to do much damage ,  his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre .   " gingerbread man "  is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller .   the film's not a complete waste ,  though .  robert downey junior ,  kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah ,  all turn in juicy performances .  the film also has a nice atmosphere ,  set against a approaching hurricane ,  and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns .  while it's not the complete disaster that scorsese's  " cape fear "  was ,  the film still never amounts to anything special .   7/10  in the late 90s altman made 3 successive films set in the american south :   " kansas city "  ,   " gingerbread man "  and  " cookie's fortune "  .  unlike  " gingerbread man "  ,  both  " kansas city "  and  " cookie's fortune "  tackle the genre on the broader ,  more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with .     " kansas city "  is the more important of these two films ,  its hierarchies of class ,  politics and crime ,  and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks ,  would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers  ( see ,  for example ,   " the wire "  )  .  that said ,   " cookie's fortune "  ,  while a much slighter tale ,  is perhaps the better picture .   note :  altman claims that this is his first thriller ,  but he directed  " images "  ,  an art house thriller ,  in 1972 .   worth one viewing . 
0	firstly ,  this is a very dated film ,  non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution .  honestly ,  when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual  (  which in itself is quite nonsensical ,  since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual )  it reduces me to despair ;  as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous .  our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities ,  but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree .  but no doubt this non-educational message ties in with godard's use of rock music ;  hence the rolling stones .   the song 'sympathy for the devil' ,  whose creation we witness ,  and from which the film takes its name ,  is in fact nothing special .  the chord sequence ,  which is not especially original ,  was used to much better effect in led zeppelin's 'thankyou' ( led zeppelin ii )  .  apart form that ,  'sir' mick jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner  ( rather like bob dylan ) - notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse .   besides the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film ,  don't seem to know what they are fighting for ,  the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography ;  a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today  (  indeed ,  a message that would belie the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made )  .   no wonder ,  the dvd came free with the sunday times !  for a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy ,  listen to luigi nono's masterpiece ,  'al gran sole carico'd'amore' . 
0	i have heard a lot about this film ,  with people writing me telling me i should see it ,  as i am a fan of extremely bloody ,  gory movies .  i got my hands on it almost right away ,  but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now .  i would have been better off not remembering i even had it .   this movie was atrocious .  the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was .  i know it was a story by clive barker and all ,  and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be ,  as i was ,  completely clueless and utterly disappointed .   the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing ,  the story interesting .  the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention .  i thought the blood looked a bit bad ,  but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on .  i was wrong .    the blood and effects are so horrible ,  it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that ,  for instance ,  someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer .  wtf ?  cgi blood  ( did they even use any  " real "  blood at all ?  my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film !  )  ,  unbelievable acts of dismemberment  ( eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head ;  arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies ?  !  )  ,  too-dark scenes  ( every scene is either an odd yellow color ,  or in hidden in shadows )  .  .  . it just gets worse and worse .  i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake .  there's just too much .  add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end .  .  . no thank you !  it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok ,  with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer .  maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant ?  plausible ,  doable .  .  . and a lot better i think than the  " real "  story .  that could have and should have worked .  instead it became a  " creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you ,  and unless you read the book ,  well .  .  . you just won't ever understand it "  fiasco .  tragic ,  what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential .  if you like mindless fake blood and gore ,  you'll love this .  but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it .  stay away- far ,  far away . 
0	i picked up tran scan from the library and brought it home .  we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like .  the film was a total waste of time ,  if i went out to buy it i would call it tran scam when i saw that it costs $49 .   the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed .   there was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product .  if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage ,  paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery .  to make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min .  oh yes the case said it was in stereo ,  the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound ,  thet could of at least put some music to it .   if you want a good cross canada film watch the railrodder / national film board of canada starring buster keaton  ( the one of the last film he made )  in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in nova scotia and travels to british columbia
0	the basic premise of  " miami golem "  most definitely deserves a spot in the top ,  say ,  fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down !  i know top 50 doesn't sound too impressive ,  but i've seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots .  i was prepared from something convoluted ,  because the film was directed and co-written by alberto de martino ,  who was one of italy's most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers .  de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters ,  like most italian directors did around that time ,  but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex ,  confusing and overwhelming .  not all of de martino's films are worthwhile ,  but some of them are extremely underrated ,  like  " a special magnum for tony saitta "  ,   " holocaust 2000 "  and  " formula for a murder "  .  the concept of  " miami golem "  contains elements from numerous great sci-fi and adventure flicks  ( like  " alien "  ,   " starman "   ,   " close encounters of the third kind "  ,   " et "  ,   )  but i wouldn't exactly call it a rip-off .  the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to harold faltermeyer's axel f .  from  " beverly hills cop "  .  the rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy ,  sci-fi ,  action ,  horror and superhero-movie gimmicks .  it certainly doesn't always make sense  ( most of the time it doesn't ,  actually )  but  " miami golem "  is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finish .   the plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but i'll try anyway .  sceptical journalist craig milford is reporting the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial dna inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it .  the dna cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size .  if this isn't problematic enough already ,  the rich mr .  anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination .  with the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise ,  craig milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus .  okay ,  i know all this sounds grotesque and silly ,  but i assure that  " miami golem "  is in fact a light-headed and easy digestible flick .  the first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing ,  because alberto de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings .  there are subliminal ghostly appearances ,  supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of atlantis .  this is all misleading padding material ,  however ,  and as soon as the set-up is more or less clear  " miami golem "  turns into an ordinary early 80's popcorn action movie with bloody massacres ,  flamboyant chase sequences  ( in the florida everglades !  )  ,  explosions ,  gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetus-monsters in jars .   now ,  i really don't want to raise the impression that  " miami golem "  is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema .  make no mistake ,  this is a pretty bad movie !  the events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you don't succeed in that ,  well than this is just a non-stop spitfire of negative aspects .  the acting performances are painfully awful .  particularly b-movie veteran john ireland ,  as the archetypal james bond villainous character ,  doesn't seem the least interested in the script .  you can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck .  laura trotter is probably the least sexy female lust-object ever ,  and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way ,  because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie .  what an embarrassment this must be for mrs .  trotter .  still ,  her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this ,  as she's quite hot from the neck down .  and ,  finally ,  there's the unforgettable scene where david warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol !  i don't think even john rambo can do this ,  while he's a beefcake vietnam veteran and warbeck's character is a simple tv-reporter . 
1	this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks .  then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in .  songs on all india radio ,  especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time ,  despite recognising their beauty !    yes ,  it did take all those years to make .  this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film ;  looking at the sumptous sets and costumes ,  not surprising !  !  not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to lata's voice .  inhi logon ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re-recorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development .  i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that weren't included in the film ,  because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them .  lata in a recent interview  ( 2007 )  rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with ,  apart from madan mohan  ( a great personal friend )  .  notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs ,  very unusual .  there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari .  kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon .  any other film ,  this song would have had close-ups of both of them .   as for this being the finest film ever ,  i would beg to differ .  it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema ,  in no particular order ,  films like barsaat  ( old )  ,  devdas  ( older versions )  ,  bandini ,  do bigha zameen ,  garam hava ,  dastak ,  guddi ,  aan ,  pyasa ,  kagaz ke phool ,  sahib bibi aur ghulam ,  kabuliwallah ,  abhimaan ,  guide ,  sujatha ,  bombay ka babu ,  daag ,  parineeta  ( old )  ,  umrao jaan ,  etc .  etc .  and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur ,  teesri manzil ,  mahal ,  aag ,  jugnu ,  anand ,  mera naam joker :  the list is really endless !   so enjoy pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above .  .  . 
0	it's a ghost story .  it's a cannibalism story .  it's a revenge story .  it's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence .  i suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen .  it has the usual isolated place ,  the cocky campers ,  heading off to the wilderness .  granted ,  there are some pretty intense scenes .  it's just so dull .  bad editing and the whole works .  there are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket .  i'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by .  it also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife .  a friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous ,  sick violence .  i fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution .  three is no cleverness here ,  no tongue in cheek ,  only a sad waste of time .  lots of blood ;  little plot . 
1	sometimes ,  lady luck smiles on me .  i had originally made -- and copied over -- a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation .  i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else .   recently ,  i subscribed to digital cable ,  and while searching through upcoming movies ,  there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie .  this time ,  however ,  i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake .   i finally got to watch it again after eight years ,  and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it .  there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with  " pandora's clock "  came with a live reading of the book on public radio .  i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch ,  and from the first installment ,  i was hooked .  each day ,  i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read .   when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie ,  i made sure to clear my schedule for that event .   first of all ,  i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book ,  contrary to what another reviewer had said .  that ,  in itself ,  is a rare achievement for tv movies .   secondly ,  i agree with others about the casting .  i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson .  literally ,  the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role .  anderson has never been better ,  and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him .  in fact ,  all of the cast members did a superb job .   my only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the  " terrorist plot "  to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane .  basically ,  we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one ,  and folks ,  that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved .  also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one ,  then two of its engines blown off .   that beef aside ,  i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film ,  as well as our own .   if you have an opportunity to see this movie ,  do so by all means . 
0	my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world  ( or at least those who will read this )  that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one .  i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid .  you could say i suffered watching it  .  .  .  my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off .  i do not recommend this to anyone .  at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case .  it is not a comedy ,  it is not drama ,  it is not action ,  it is not horror ,  it is just horrible ! 
0	this has to be the worst movie ever !  !  !  the acting is scarier than the movie .  lots of blood ,  but no idea where it comes from ,  cuz they don't even show you the cuts .  i can't believe i wasted my time watching this movie .  we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie .  this is a disgrace to horror films !  !  !  for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash cans ?  !  there's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time .  the film editing is a joke ,  my teenager could do better .  and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue .  do not watch this movie !  !  !  not to even see how bad it is ,  you will be sorry you did !  ! 
0	i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival .  i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film .  and crispin glover's film is outrageous .  he basically exploits the mentally challenged .  not only is shirly temple the anti-christ  ( which i admit is a little funny )  telling the mentally challenged to kill each other ,  but there is an obsession with killing snails .  crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are ,  mentally challenged .  peta and human rights should be all over this thing .  it's not 'counter-culture' as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival ,  it's exploitation . 
1	i cannot believe how unknown this movie is , it was absolutely incredible .  the ending alone has stuck with me for almost thirty years .  the road sign through the rearveiw mirror blew me away .  if you liked  " race with the devil "  you will love this movie
1	in any number of films ,  you can find nicholas cage as a strong ,  silent hero ,  dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac ,  lara flynn boyle as a vamp/tramp ,  and the late ,  lamented j . t .  walsh as the heavy .  these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep ,  and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche .  what a relief ,  therefore ,  that john dahl ,  a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action ,  directed this nuanced noirish thriller .  hopper manages to keep from going over the top ,  cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes ,  boyle is by turns sultry ,  innocent ,  and scheming ,  and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character ,  wayne .  dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store .  the plot twists are top-notch ,  and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains .  it isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors .  but with a director as smart as dahl ,  you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film .  an excellent movie . 
0	this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen .   i have to disagree with another commenter ,  who said the special effects were okay .  i found them pretty bad :  it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story .   maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story .  the archaeologists are looking for  " the set "  .  they do not bother to tell what set ,  or what is so special about it .  that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california ,  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt .   if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert ,  take the effort to actually go to the desert .  the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert .   the action-level was constant throughout the movie ,  no ups and downs ,  no climax .  it made the movie look short ,  and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie . 
1	there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship ,  stuff he dare not dream about .   as doctor edward morbius ,  pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier .  since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter ,  anne francis .  they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell .   the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin .  the machinery they left behind is still functioning .   maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion .    i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956 .  the terms would change ,  we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive ,  courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek .   we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship .  it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey .  it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change .   the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one ,  about mortal beings trying to play god .   you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot .  this mechanical marvel ,  put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day .  he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space .  his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny .   robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar ,  but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea .  forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b .  demille .   classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction .    my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with .   never miss this one whenever it's broadcast . 
1	i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece .  it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew .  it began with great visuals ,  little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild .  as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place .  a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time .  the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot .  along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall .  the score ,  though not bad ,  gave the film almost a music video feel .  it just felt a little dated ,  not adding anything to further the storyline .  some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece .  i walk away from this very satisfied .  i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice-over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed .  great job ! 
0	this review is based on the dubbed shock-o-rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002 .  how bad is it ?  it's awful ,  which is what a '1' represents on the imdb scale--but it's much worse than that .  it's nice to imagine that an original german-language print might improve matters--the comedic english-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully ,  this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see .  the zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever ,  and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal .  however ,  they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation .  george romero's land of the dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence ;  here ,  zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director andreas schnaas .  utterly without redeeming social value ,  and even worse ,  entirely lacking as entertainment ,  zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it . 
1	cat soup has two  " hello kitty " -type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife ,  where anything can happen ,  and does .  this mind-tripping asian short uses no dialog ,  substituting word balloons instead .  there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself .  and make sure no one under 10 is in the room .  dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes .  honest .  perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in ,  and also ride .  but like practically everything else in this film ,  that silly ,  picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end . 
0	i picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store ,  adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie ,  well ,  it wasn't .  there was absolutely no story line at all ,  bad jokes ,  and the other comedian said  " the f-word "  every other word he said , cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top .  and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie ,  it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions .  and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie .  in my opinion ,  don't buy this movie ,  its a waste of money
0	this film had a lot of promise ,  and the plot was relatively interesting ,  however the actors ,  director and editors seriously let this film down .   i feel bad for the writers ,  it could have been good .  the acting is wooden ,  very few of the characters are believable .   who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film .  there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene ,  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying .   i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no ,  it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money . 
0	i went into this movie with high hopes .  normally ,  i'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch ,  or so i thought .  i'll list the good parts of this movie :  -the creature effects .  all of the creatures were well-done ,  their movements were realistic ,  and they fit into the other imagery well .  to be honest ,  the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1 .  now ,  the bad things :  -the acting .  good lord ,  i've seen bad acting ,  but this movie takes the cake .  not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable .  it's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it .  i tried very hard not to giggle too loud ,  cause i didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre ,  but the acting really was that bad .  -the storyline :  the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish .  you can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film .  the plot holes ,  of course ,  are complimentary with the cheese .  this is probably one of the most clichéd ,  not thought-out ,  and outright dumbest stories i've ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching parasite on the scifi channel .  -the dialogue :  this is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can ,  at every chance they possibly can .  in this world ,  it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies .  it is the world of cheese and cliché .  -the special effects .  while the creature effects were downright awesome ,  the special effects fail miserably .  yes ,  they are better than those seen in other movies ,  but a lot of it is in the presentation .  and this movie has no presentation whatsoever .  it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show ,  to be honest .  to sum up :  dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money .  the concept is good ,  but it is trapped in the bad directing ,  acting ,  dialogue ,  and cheesiness of the film .  wait til the next big monster movie comes out .  it's gotta be better than this ,  cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible . 
0	one scene demonstrates the mentality of  " terminator woman "  pretty well :  karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp .  karen runs across an armed guard ,  who points his gun at her ,  but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight .  karen kicks him in the balls ,  picks up the gun and runs away !  then again ,  when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family ,  you know you shouldn't expect too much .  karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on ,  and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship .  but after about 20 minutes they get separated ,  and the film slows to a crawl ,  and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up ,  it lacks excitement .  the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat ,  but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value .  on the positive side ,  kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film !   ( *1/2 ) 
0	i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts .  actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities .  anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster .  i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average .  i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler . 
0	you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card .  a sappy ,  trite verse and that will be $3 . 99 ,  thank you very much .  you get the same with a hallmark movie .  here we get a ninety year old ernie borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact ,  he is not dead like we thought .  poor ernie ,  he is the poor soul that married ethel merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks .  in this flick ,  ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid .  we have seen it before .  you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned . 
0	god ,  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot .  i had been expecting a lot from it ,  as i'm a huge fan of james cameron  ( and not just since  " titanic "  ,  i might add )  ,  and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality  ( then again ,  he also wrote the leaden strange days .  .  )  .  but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration .  in all that time ,  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis ,  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere .  on top of that ,  i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular  " a-team "  episode .  as for alba ,  yes ,  she is gorgeous ,  of course ,  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie  ( pouty and surly )  ,  makes me also get bored of her  " gal wit an attitude "  schtick pretty soon .  you can count me out of this one ,  mr .  cameron ! 
1	i don't know why i picked this movie to watch ,  it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different .  every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different .  right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real .  i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end .  i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors .    at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being ,  and are left with the 'things are going to be ok' type of a feeling .  i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance . 
1	i love these  " diaper baby "  movies !  you couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history .  it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh ,  which it does .  how they ever got these kids to  " act "  i'll never know .  i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's .  you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young ,  the stock market had crashed ,  the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world .  the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension ,  but then dinner for 25 cents is too .  it was a different time with a totally different mind set . 
0	my spouse & i found this movie to be very schlocky .  it started out good ,  but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous .  most of the acting was poor ,  with the exception of the little girl ,  abbie ,  who really was terrific .  in addition ,  the dialog was predictable & lame - especially gideon ,  the angel's .  also ,  without giving away anything ,  when one of the characters has a tragedy ,  she almost appears nonchalant .  at first we thought it was 'shock' ,  but then we realized that it was just a terrible script .  we love almost all of the hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories ,  but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one .  there are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie . 
1	man ,  some of you people have got to chill .  this movie was artistic genius .  instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality ,  why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction ?  a story .  entertainment ,  for god's sake  ( no pun intended )  .  it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well .  i'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton's job at directing ,  that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him .  ya know ,  if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line ,  you might just enjoy the film .  me and all of my friends did ! 
1	the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events .  some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy .  i find the program to be informative and inspirational .  it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful .  there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them .  while mr .  robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated ,  i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism .  i have certainly said some foolish things in my life .  i would certainly be willing to forgive mr .  robertson since he puts out a great show . 
1	moon child is the story of two brothers and a friend trying to make it in a futuristic ,  economically-unstable japan .  after a cunning disaster gone wrong ,  someone new enters young sho's life ,  a special friend by the name of kei .  years later they have grown rather close ,  and have found ways to combine both their talents into one unstoppable team .  during another escapade ,  they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends .  before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart .  alliances turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down .  regrets and hopelessness claim some while power and success take others .  tragedy claims still others .  truths are revealed and lives are forever changed .    and you will never see a more beautiful sunrise .   this movie is a gripping tale of undying friendships ,  webs of relationships ,  and a team that not even death can keep apart for too long .  moon child combines sci-fi ,  drama ,  and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time ,  and great for most audiences .  it minimizes the everyday romances and puts more emphasis on the important values we can all relate to such as friendships ,  loyalty ,  and believing in yourself .  nothing could possibly compare .  i personally have never seen anything quite like it ,  and i don't suspect i ever will again .   it appeals to the wider population in many ways and is a must see for all . 
0	i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like .  definitely ,  the broken is not one of those movies .  i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments ,  they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people .  the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain .  it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless .  so ,  you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before .  though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue .  had the clues been planted more in the movie ,  one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed .  but though the movie was so slow in pace ,  it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all .  and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments .  furthermore ,  if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end ,  then how come she is the evil one ?  i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion :  this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time .  obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all .  i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies .  horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages !  they're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest ,  i guess .  horror movies should have blood ,  screams ,  intensity ,  skeletons ,  body organs and parts .  because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality .  i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising .  nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of .  for instance ,  the horror movie  " train "  with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with  " hostel "  ,  it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them .   and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message ,  it is still very poorly presented and the least scary .  i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex ,  tv ,  safety/being pampered ,  etc .  .  .  can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me .  and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial ,  are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ,  ecstasy ,  leadership lessons  ( believe it or not !  )  ,  entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life ,  as ugly and scary as it may seems ,  death ! 
0	i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious .  this movie went nowhere fast .  what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars ,  a picture of some dude's swimming pool  ( he really needs to answer his phone by the way )  a dot matrix printer doing its job ,  and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating  " t minus 10 and counting "  as if something exciting is going to happen .  it doesn't so don't get your hopes up .  the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc ,  in something other than there famous tv personalities ,  and that is stretching to find anything good .  and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani ,  some large marine mammals ,  and microphone feedback .  this movie is as close as i have given a one yet ,  but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure ,  and didn't have to leave in the middle .  avoid at all costs . 
1	deeply emotional .  it can't leave you neutral .   yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys .  but it's only the body of this movie .  and it's been removed .  you only feel what happened with these boys .  you feel the soul of the movie .  with of course some action ,  some sex ,  but this is no pornography ,  too many feelings .   it was only a summer  " story "  ,  and it became ,  from love to hate ,  almost to death ,  the most important time of their lives .  i loved it ,  you will too ,  whatever your feelings are . 
1	well ,  here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film-making !  the rudimentary premise of  " what's the matter with helen ?  "  is quite shocking and disturbing ,  but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion !  in the hands of any other movie crew ,  this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale ,  but with director curtis harrington  (  " whoever slew auntie roo ?  "  )  and scriptwriter henry farrell  (  " hushhushsweet charlotte "  )  in charge ,  it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres .  the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific ,  but there's a lot more to experience ,  like love stories ,  a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing !  the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique .  we're literally catapulted back to the 1930's ,  with a sublime depiction of that era's music ,  religion ,  theatrical business and wardrobes .  following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder ,  adelle  ( debbie reynolds )  and helen  ( shelley winters )  flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls .  particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment ,  as she falls in love with a local millionaire ,  but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia .  she only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist ,  fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies .  the script ,  although not entirely without flaws ,  is well written and the film is adequately paced .  there's never a dull moment in  " what's the matter with helen "  ,  although the singing ,  tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot .  but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters .  she's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and ,  especially during the last ten minutes or so ,  she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers ,  jason voorhees' and michael myers' combined !  there are several terrific supportive characters who are ,  sadly ,  a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential ,  like michéal macliammóir as the cocky elocution teacher ,  agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies' house .  there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us ,  but particularly the set pieces and costume designs  ( even nominated for an oscar !  )  are breathtaking . 
0	i wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute  " borat "  tonight ,  and left quite disappointed .  i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit ,  and routinely go to see animated films .  that being said ,  i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out ,  but stayed waiting for this film to get better .  never happened .   the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch ,  especially in my opinion ,  that of kate winslet and ian mckellen  ( i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto )  .  the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add-set .  it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another ,  weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an  " important message .  "  it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category ,  and considering the way it's scoring with critics ,  i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware .  but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats ,  take my advice and wait for ratatouille . 
0	this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal .  or as i should say steven so-dull !  like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines ,  leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped .  a few films before this was he has done this too ,  but i don't think to this extent !  to be honest the film looks pretty good ,  the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie !  of course ,  all told ,  this film is pretty bad .   it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself .  don't bother .  anything over a buck for this one is too much !  i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film .  what's taken me so long to realize this ?  ! 
1	 " show people "  is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines .  what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl ,  peggy pepper ,  whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen .  though she's a success in comedy ,  what she wants to do is make  " art "  so she moves up to high arts studio .  soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy .   many stars of the silent era have cameos in  " show people ,  "  including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup .  i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928 ,  they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene ;  sadly ,  nowadays ,  it's not the case ,  even for film buffs .  in one part of the film ,  however ,  she does meet charlie chaplin ;  in another ,  author elinor glyn is pointed out to her ,  and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film .  other stars who pop up in  " show people "  are john gilbert ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  leatrice joy ,  bess flowers ,  renee adoree ,  rod laroque ,  aileen pringle ,  and many others .   davies was adorable and a lively comedienne .  it's a shame william haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic ,  deservedly an enormous star back in the day .    " show people "  is a simple story told in a witty way .  it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars . 
0	i didn't think it could be done ,  but something has come along and replaced open house- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film i've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life .   it was touted as the best film in montreal's most recent film festival ,  which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry .   watching this movie was like a little slice of hell .  it's from austria ,  and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly .  there's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him ,  the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child ,  the über-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists .  .  .  the list goes on .  forever .  much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatre .   yes ,  the characters interact ,  but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way .  i couldn't say if they were any good as actors ,  as ,  according to the subtitles ,  they were given lines that were the austrian equivalent of  " you are so lame !  "  they certainly didn't have to learn many ,  as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene .   this is no gummo ,  or any of the aforementioned movies .  there is no art to discover ,  and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your  " never walk out during a movie "  policy  ( which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing ,  it's not ,  unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples ,  to boot- revolting )  .   this movie was offensive to me .  not the flabby nudity ,  not the cringe-inducing soundtrack ,  not the shockless scenes involving guns .  i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding .  i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us montrealers could find .  most of all ,  i was offended that ,  somehow ,  the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease .   
1	in my opinion ,  this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece .  if you ask me ,  the stepmother  ( voice of lucille la verne )  was truly diabolical .  you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why .  on the other hand ,  despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping ,  cinderella  ( voice of ilene stanley )  was a very beautiful lady .  to me ,  the scenery was beautiful ,  the cast was well chosen ,  and the writing was strong .  before i wrap this up ,  i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well .  now ,  in conclusion ,  i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it .  you're in for a good time ,  so go to the video store ,  rent it or buy it ,  kick back with a friend ,  and watch it . 
0	ira levin's broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones ,  a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about .  frustrated writer michael caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own ;  his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid ,  which has caine's flighty spouse up in arms .  the first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead ,  with caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up .  dyan cannon is miscast as his wife  ( she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz )  and christopher reeve  ( in the middle portion of the film )  seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer .  these three characters ,  and irene worth's bothersome neighbor ,  are so undefined that what happens after the set-up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun .  sidney lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy ,  the set design unconvincing and poorly-lit ,  and the finale is a total disaster .  the actors struggle to give the script some substance ,  but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts .  *1/2 from ****
1	the original vampires  ( 1998 )  is one of my favorites .  i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters .  i was quite surprised at how this played out .  as a rule ,  sequels are never as good as the original ,  with a few exceptions .  though this one was not a great movie ,  the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact .  jon bon jovi was a drawback initially ,  but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer .  i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one ,  though .  .  .  unless you bring in buffy !   all in all ,  this was a decent watch & i would watch it again .   i was left with two questions ,  though .  .  .  what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer ?  guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination . 
1	there is indeed much to complain about this movie version of molnar's mystical play --farrell looks good in his title role ,  but his line readings ,  frankly ,  stink .  this also suffers ,  in large part ,  from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection .  the sets look phony .   there are two great strengths in this show ,  however :  although the dialogue readings limp ,  the visual performances are perfect .  rose hobart ,  as julie ,  is little remembered today :  mostly for rose hobart ,  in which joseph cornell cut down the programmer east of borneo to simply shots of her :  credit melford's stylish visual direction of the original .  her great beauty and simple  ( although stagy )  performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie .   however ,  one of borzage's themes is the mystical power of love ,  and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great ,  from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the hot place' .  h . b .  warner's performance here is ,  as always ,  perfect .   so we have here a flawed but very interesting version .  i think that lang's 1934 version is better ,  as well as the celestial scenes in the henry king version of carousel ,  the watered-down musical remake .  but i still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance . 
1	fast paced and funny satire about that original  " reality tv "  ,  the soap opera .  the script by playwright robert harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations .  the best of them is the climax ,  a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant .  keven kline's murdering of his lines ,  due to not wearing his glasses ,  is hilarious .   " her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses .  "  the brilliant cast is on the same page as kline .  sally field ,  elizabeth shue ,  cathy moriarty ,  robert downey jr .  ,  whoopi goldberg ,  teri hatcher ,  garry marshall ,  and kathy najimy are all perfect .  it is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie .  this is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks .   p . s .  the score by alan silvestri is an added bonus .  it fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air . 
1	this is the best made-for-tv movie of all-time !  am i saying this because i'm a huge silverstone fan ?  partially ,  but even without her ,  i'd still see it .  i'm a fan of serial killer genre films ,  and believe this to be a great entry in that category .  also ,  mary giordano easily ranks among alicia's top five character creations .  totally memorable - like she really exists .  i'd have her on my side ,  too ,  if there was a mystery to be solved .  she plays the character ,  like she does with her real life ,  with complete confidence in everything she does .  seems sweet ,  honest ,  nice .  .  . just like she is in real life .  so is that acting ?  yes ,  indeed ,  she's sort of a rebel once again .  this time she's not bad ,  she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law .  but she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do .  instead ,  she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes .  a cliche abounds :  she's sort of avenging her father's death ,  in a different way than vigilante-style .  at the time ,  alicia seemed to be playing the same characters :  rebellious ,  seductive ,  without a parent ,  a loner .  this happens here ,  too ,  but she's a bit nerdy this time around .  that doesn't matter ;  she's still cool as a nerd .  check this out soon ,  or else giordano will be investigating why you haven't .  .  . 
1	titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship .  writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 ,  1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic .  the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet .  they make for a good on-screen couple .  dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable .  they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well .  the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane ,  kathy bates ,  frances fisher ,  jonathan hyde ,  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film .  the love story ,  the action ,  suspense ,  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time .  the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation .  the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws .  titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it .  the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg .  overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch . 
1	 " magic "  isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves .  you find yourself relaxing ,  and seeing others in a more benevolent light .  .  .  any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention .  seldom are we soaked in beauty like this .  as if that weren't enough ,  it's funny .  performances are ,  without exception ,  extraordinary ,  but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson ,  and the superb josie walker - both open like roses .   why isn't this film on dvd ?  it deserves to live forever . 
0	the minute you give an 'art film' 1/10 ,  you have people baying for your ignorant ,  half-ass-ed ,  artistically retarded blood .  i won't try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10 .  all i ask is that someone explain to me the point ,  purpose and message of this film .   here is how i would summarize the film :  opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence .  this followed by  ( in a nutshell ,  to save you 3 hours of pain )  the following - a children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter ,  who he may or may not have raped when she was a child ,  and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues ,  while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy ,  a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s ,  who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery' ,  while the game show's producer ,  himself dying of lung cancer ,  asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago ,  and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru ,  even as mr .  producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man ;  and oh ,  eventually ,  it rains frogs  ( you read correctly )  .  and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless ,  literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than ,  possibly ,  to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic' .    you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie  ( and in turn of not confusing you )  if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently ,  maybe in a few sentences instead of just one .  .  .  well ,  now you know how i feel . 
1	there's a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist ,  actually exist right now .  it's a bit too much to wrap your head around ,  but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place .  for barbara jean trenton  ( ida lupino )  ,  that time was twenty five years earlier ,  the mid 1930's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise .  for my part ,  if i could travel through time ,  it would be back to the 1950's when i grew up .  maybe to a place like willoughby ,  but that's another episode .   one thing that wouldn't be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of  " the twilight zone "  .  how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series ,  and then find a particular story you wanted to watch ?  i guess you have to consider the trade offs ,  convenience versus simplicity ,  having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins .  popping in a cd has it's advantages .   i'm a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled  " sunset boulevard "  .  ida lupino's character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept .  martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim ,  the husband turned butler who's loyalty is unquestioned .  where the story diverges has to do with the way danny  ( balsam )  and sall  ( ted de corsia )  challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence .   fortunately for us viewers ,  ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were 'not big ,  but a nice showcase' .  it's a real treat to watch any episode of  " the twilight zone "  and get to see who pops up from days gone by .  sometimes you get a two-fer ,  like you have here with lupino and balsam ,  celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began ,  and sometimes after .  combined with the stories that the program produced ,  it's not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today . 
1	a real classic ,  ten out of ten !  every actor is perfect ,  the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes .  scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking .  wonder if this film is already out in dvd ,  because it must be seen in widescreen version .  saw this film in the late fifties ,  maybe three or four times ,  and never since then forgot it . i remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features ,  process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography .  shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performances . the only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like ,  say nicholas ray ,  to increase its rhythm and tension . 
0	i don't see what everyone liked about this movie .  the set-up was too long and talky ,  and when it was done ,  the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene .  after the film finally got cusack into the eponymous hotel room ,  i had to wonder ,  well ,  what's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged .  the answer :  not much ,  just john cusack having a long ,  drawn-out ,  mental breakdown .   maybe if the cusack character had more depth  .   .  maybe if his freak-out were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life  .   .   .  maybe if the film had either better developed its half-baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place  .   .   .  maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill-ride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles  .   .   .  i dunno .  all i do know is that i saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us much liked it .   except for the disquieting episode on the hotel ledge ,  the alarming crazy lady with the hammer ,  and the so-stupid-it-was-fun crypt keeper in the air duct ,  all three of which account for no more than five minutes of screen time ,  this film was a bore .   by the way ,  this story seems to steal ideas from the shining and use them here to much less powerful effect .  is stephen king now reduced to stealing ideas from himself ? 
1	the performance of every actor and actress  ( in the film )  are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be ;  and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again .  however ,  i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director ,  attenborough's credits that puzzles me :  aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent ,  long lasting film for the audience ?  i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one  ( possibly one of the  " knowledgeable "  personnel  ( insider )  of the film . 
1	like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons ,  this movie has humor at different levels .  i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son .  both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times .  .  .  and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan .  the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times .  .  .  the adult-level humor  ( that is ,  humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences ,  no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here )  keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults .  for example of the adult level humor ,  the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors .  the martian pilot ,  blaznee ,  has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson ;  the scientist ,  that of peter seller's dr .  strangelove .  the special effects are surprisingly good for this film .  the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor ,  and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power  ( an excellent example is wayne alexander's  " vern "  character )  .  i had to write this review .  .  .  the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now .  good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie . 
0	who me ?  no ,  i'm not kidding .  that's what it really says on the video case .   plot ;  short version :  pretty woman stands around smiling .  this ,  for some reason ,  makes all men kill each other .    " find ariel .  .  . where's ariel .  .  . can't find ariel .  .  .  "  she's right behind you ,  you idiot .  .  .   most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said ,  looks like .   a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly .  then they get knocked off in the same way .  every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance .  perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check .  the alien virus/hologram/vr witch/glitch seems physically powerless and doesn't do a thing .  why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her  " teleporting vampire "  routine ?   ( actually ,  it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire ,  or doing more than just standing around looking at people ,  which is all she ever does .  this is enough to make all the men kill each other .  go figure .  .  .  )   this isn't really a space flick .  there are far more shots of the old western trail ,  1950's easy rider trail ,  film noir's night club scene ,  even a jog on the beach in fantasy-land ,  none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense .  the night club scene is in black and white ,  of course .  worked with  " the wizard of oz "  .  doesn't work so well ,  here .  this is probably a good thing ,  as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly .  you will probably cry during those moments ,  especially upon seeing that swirling  " space ship "  ,  which looks about three inches long .   nothing is felt for any of the characters ,  not because they are convicts or have no personality ,  but because they are in serious need of acting lessons ,  except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss ,  probably by being in this work .  .  .   this is one of those movies that ,  when viewed with friends ,  is going to cause some extremely  " loud "  silences ,  especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one-liners  ( including the line about french-kissing a meteor .  .  .  ?  did i hear that right ?  perhaps not .  .  .  )   the original virtual reality girls get  " killed "  ,  which means nothing ,  as they are not even real to begin with .  well ,  the other  " characters "  aren't ,  either ,  but that's beside the point .  haha .   what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing  ( green filter added on top of that ,  to give it more of a .  .  . uh .  .  . green look )  ,  which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot .   another odd deal i noticed .  whenever there is an explosion  ( at least on my cheap dvd copy )  ,  everything becomes highly pixelated .  i don't mean a little pixelated ,  i mean huge blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen .  wow . 
1	i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role .  compared to sharon stone ,  madonna is too coarse and bauerisch .  she's not even close .    evil incarnate :  sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth ,  the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding .  however ,  she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption .  in the obligatory sex scene ,  she projects pure ,  crystalline lust .  especially her hooded ,  luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure .  thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques ,  the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest .  rather ,  she seems to have a slight golden glow  ( yes ,  yeats )  .    the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes  . the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed .  i wouldn't have had a chance .   the original basic instinct ;  attempts at censorship :  i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film ,  set in san francisco ,  a beautiful city worthy of this film .  it is outstanding ,  from the music to the locations to the sets ,  and so on .  paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew .    that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups .  attempts at censorship were vehemently denied .  swell .  these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script ,  insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas .  example :  sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny ,  they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy .    on locations in san francisco ,  the gentle ,  tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise ,  flashing lights and other tactics .  the executive producers ,  mario kassar and andrew vajna ,  vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics .    blowback :  thanks to the fulminating activists ,  the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising .  their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched .  it also received widespread critical acclaim .  it was ,  in the words of the reptilian hackett in network ,   " a big- titted hit !  "  sorry ,  gentle reader ;  i just couldn't resist that one .  yes ,  it's a gibe .   in conclusion ,  i believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2 ,  with their brilliant musical scores ,  aesthetics and acting ,  are works of art   that deserve protection under our constitution . 
1	this movie shows how savage the troubles really are .  people who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered .  this movie shows how the people of northern ireland ,  both catholic and protestant are held captive .  at any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not . 
1	michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name ,  including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out .  iphigenia ,  however ,  is a highlight .  adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides ,  it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel .  the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film ,  with the emphasis placed on the simple story :  in supplication to the gods ,  king agamemnon  ( kostas kazakos ) is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia  ( tatiana papamoschou )  ,  much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae  ( irene papas )  .  kazakos and papas are both outstanding ,  but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen ,  blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game .  strongly recommended for fans of international cinema . 
1	the first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place ;  then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with .  which is exactly what a young latino girl does in `girlfight , ' written and directed by karyn kusama .  diana  ( michelle rodriguez )  is an eighteen-year-old high school senior from the projects in brooklyn ,  facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester .  she affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go .  she lives with her father ,  sandro  ( paul calderon )  ,  with whom she has a very tentative relationship ,  and her younger brother ,  tiny  ( ray santiago )  .  with her life teetering on the brink of dissolution ,  she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her .  and one day she finds it ,  without even looking for it ,  when she stops by the gym where tiny trains .  ironically ,  tiny wants nothing to do with boxing ;  he wants to go to art school ,  but sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets ,  and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons .  when diana convinces tiny's trainer ,  hector  ( jaime tirelli )  ,  to take her on ,  and approaches her father for the money ,  under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance  ( she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for )  ,  sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money .  ultimately ,  with tiny's help she finds a way ,  and the ring soon becomes her second home .  it's an environment to which she readily adapts ,  and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better .  and the fact that she will have to fight men ,  not women ,  in `gender blind' competitions ,  does not faze her in the least .  diana has found her element .   
0	an offensively over-the-top action adventure , first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it's release in the mid-80's , with right-wing reaganism and virulent anti-red feelings still not finished yet , though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the 'evil empire' in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant ; even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism .   in that sense , we can be most grateful to 'gorby' , not for his disarmament treaties with the us , nor his policies of 'glasnost' , or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union's backyard . no , it's the final diminution of foolish , jingoistic , bloated cold-war adventures like this . the first rambo film was hardly perfect , though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline . in this sequel , any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly , senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single-handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow's ten years after the conflict ended , with the americans on the losing side .   perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box-office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy ; they may have lost the war , but there was still unfinished business at hand , and ludicrous comic-strip heroics with a robot-like hero killing virtually every red on sight , with as much hardware as possible , fulfilled such whimsically far-fetched ideals .   this could have been entertaining on a superman/spiderman level , but sadly everything is played absolutely straight . but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film ; sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind . the action scenes , though technically adequate , never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness , because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts ; namely , our hero rambo is always unscathed  ( aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there )  despite the tons of explosives , grenades , gunshots , etc . going around him .   in between the mayhem , what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities . stallone , who co-wrote the script with james cameron  ( a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year )  , deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english , and merely comes out with moronic grunts , almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself . maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character !  in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did !  the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given , and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb/red army villain roles . berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing . how come that sly managed to survive berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags ?  well , credibility is never this film's strong point . it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz . at least that was meant to be a fantasy , and an immortal classic it turned out to be . this is only a classic of the most dismal , and indeed offensive , kind . and as for sly's climactic speech .  .  .  , rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people , eh ?  by the way , in the same year , he also made rocky iv .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   rating : 3 out of 10 . 
0	i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop's .  and this one surely is an oop .  one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out ,  she never became a mega star .  that's one of the reason's many of her films are oop .  she gives a good performance in this movie .  it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends .  played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 ,  that's funny .  the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity .  in most editions it's cut out ,  why ,  i don't know ,  no blood is involved ,  okay ,  blair is butt naked but nothing is shown ,  no t&a so nothing to offend people .  but the movie is slow ,  extremely slow .  it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep .  it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows ,  no gore no nothing .  why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me .  if you're a fan of blair ,  buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is . 
0	much worse than the original .  it was actually *painful* to sit through ,  and it barely held my six year old's interest .   introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting ,  but storyline is extra-thin ,  dialogue is still bad ,  and music is mediocre .  watch the television show instead - it's much better . 
0	yes ,  this was pure unbelievable condescending babble .  we know that the french often have a skewed idea of the usa ,  it's puritanism and views towards sex .  as an american  ( hoosier )  who lives in france ,  i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes .  and while some of these preconceived notions may be true ,  not one element of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real .  a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big ?  where in the world would you find that ?  a juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass ?  a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago ,  but with no major gas station ,  no tvs in the home ,  no mcdonalds ,  no kids .  .  .  a population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other .  the adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe ,  have farms but don't harvest ,  kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it ,  and all with equal emotion ?  the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity ,  the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy ?  help !  i am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is .  go see it for the a-to-z primer on what to avoid .  gosh ,  i hope i didn't ruin it for you ! 
1	a must see !  i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious .  we're talking nonstop laughs .  it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama .  amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty ,  brains ,  and serious acting ability .  peter cohen ,  the director ,  has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world .  for all of it's comedy ,  whipped succeeds with it's intelligence .  which is so rare for a first time director ,  especially with a romantic comedy .  he is a major talent .  judah domke ,  brian van holt ,  jonathan abrahams ,  and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady's men .  you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet's web .  check out the trailer on whipped . com ,  it's worth the 3 minute download . 
1	i love the newer episodes with cj and grandad - i also liked the storyline with kate falling for the principal .  i want to find out what happens to rory and kerry and bridget and the family next .  i think cj is very funny and i love his scenes with grandad .  i have always loved james garner in everything he does ,  and it is a credit to his acting that i never think of him as james garner or rockford in this series and totally believe in him as kate's dad .  this family is so real and funny .  it was terribly sad when john ritter / paul hennessey died ,  but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with .  but generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun . 
0	if there was a zero rating ,  i would give it to this movie .  today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end .  i can't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise !  the acting is atrocious all around ,  the script is blah ,  the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened .  the  " southern "  accent from the actress playing amber's mom is laughable - i'm from georgia and have friends from texas - believe me nobody talks like that !  none of her emotions seemed real in any scene .  the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment . 
0	i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan ( releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture )   , it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences .  i think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences . so it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction . give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala ! 
1	the movie was very moving .  it was tender ,  and funny at the same time .  the scenery was absolutely beautiful !  peter faulk and paul reiser gave award winning performances .  olympia dukakis was great .  i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief ,  but i did wish i could have seen more of her-she is a true pro . you will be able to recall experiences from your own life  ,  hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie .  we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing .  he is a wonderful man ,  clever ,  eloquent and a  " real person "  .  it was truly an enjoyable night out ! this is a must see movie .  you will be so grateful you went . 
1	a sweet and totally charming film ,  shall we dansu ?  made me laugh and cry .  at first appearance ,  sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing--an uptight salaryman ,  seemingly devoted to his family ,  but all too easily captivated by a face in a window .  the object of his obsession is distant and cold .  but by the end of the movie ,  i was in love with him ,  her ,  his wife and daughter ,  all the dance instructors and dance students .  this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again . 
1	i used to watch this show when i was a little girl .  when i think about it ,  i only remember it vaguely .  if you ask me ,  it was a good show .  two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song .  in addition to that ,  everyone was ideally cast .  also ,  the writing was very strong .  the performances were top-grade ,  too .  i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode .  before i wrap this up ,  i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever ,  even though i don't think i've seen every episode .  now ,  in conclusion ,  if some network ever brings it back ,  i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good . 
0	having listened to and enjoyed harvey bernhard's omen ii commentary i was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish .  it's like a really bad tv movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote .  i think at the bit where michael lerner is confronted by what i can only describe as a high school cast of les miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief .  and then my mouth was going up and down because i was laughing so much .  dire .  i don't know why i have to write a minimum of ten lines ,  i have made my point succinctly ,  there's nothing clever about all this modern verbiage . 
1	i have just finished watching this film in my gcse history class .  it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law .  how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish .  it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people .  in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are ,  this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites .  donald woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid .  he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south africa and went on to awaken the world .  i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people .  it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal ,  their fate should not be determined by the colour of somebody's skin .  n
0	this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological .  i stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater ,  their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes -- eyes wandering at their neighbor ,  wondering if it was just them .  i mean ,  how could the movie really be bad .  nobody'll admit it ,  it's a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes .   " who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner ?  "  but the fact remains ,  every member of the audience is thinking what i'm writing right now .  i actually plagiarized their faces .   obviously lois is only aroused by power ,  she won't even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn't stop jet liners .  it can't be the look in  " his "  eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that .  in the old supermans ,  she had some level of connection with him ,  he wasn't priority number 1 ,  obviously ,  but it strengthened her character that she was  " torn "  .  i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kent .   and now it's official ,  kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg .  person .   superman  " one "  he loses his earth dad ,  then finds his real super dad ,  the story is captivating every step of the way .  he's human ,  he relates to people and he feels love for people ,  he relates to highschool students ,  he relates to people who feel different .  he relates .  the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems he's just  " doing a job "  when he's saving people .   there's something about clark that lois likes ,  she's really internally in love with him but can't admit it ,  and when he comes into the picture as superman ,  it throws a kink in the on-the-rocks love .  without superman ,  she would've fallen in love with clark  ( at least that's what the movie points to ,  whether it was the intention or not )  .  superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman ,  clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois .  literally .   superman two i just watched it again .  as a kid ,  i  " thought "  i enjoyed the action ,  but now i know it was the story that held me then too ,  watching it over and over again .  if i saw superman returns as a child ,  i would've hated it then too ,  i think .   there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie ,  it's sick .  superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile ,  meanwhile ,  lex luther's got something fantastic up his sleeve .   superman three now there's a three-way love story between superman and lana and clark ,  only humanity wins and clark's inner nature beats superman's power ,  because when his supermoral nature is gone and he's superhuman  ( who does human things with his superpowers )  ,  she sees it's not the power of superman that she's in love with ,  it's not superpowerman ,  but supermortalman that she loves -- and who's really super .  and when she tells clark she  " prefers "  him to superman ,  he is elated ,  he has made a human connection again .  he wants to be accepted for who he is ,  not just for his ability to bend steel .  this is the kind of stuff that's missing from superman returns .   clark super-sneezes to help the kid get a strike - humanity again .  plus ,  it's an ineresting use of superpowers .  he's not just using straight brute strength .   he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers ,  love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving .   it seems there's nothing at stake in superman returns .  even in superman three ,  we see the damages caused by the nemesis' world domination plot .  .  we see suffering ,  we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it .  .  there's no damage ,  esp .  emotional from lex's plot to sink the us .  we see a glob of crystal thrown into space .  .  superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him ,  he couldn't just  " access "  his superpowers .  in the first one ,  he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois' life .  .  .   ( this was thirty years ago !  !  "  )  in the second one ,  he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than ,  but combined with lex's genius ,  and the villains' immoral tactics ,  superman's overpowering wasn't enough ,  he had to work one against the other and outsmart them .  .  .  in superman iii ,  again ,  his superpowers weren't enough to win .  .  he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw .  he couldn't use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance ,  so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression .  and he found that acid earlier when he couldn't simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire ,  so he had to use his superbrains -- he couldn't carry water ,  so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire .  .  now in superman returns ,  he simply lunges the island into outerspace ,  like a night temp for ups .  he doesn't need to figure anything out ,  he just uses his  " super strength "  .  and lex luther's brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk .   to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face ,  but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn't grey poupon he was looking at . 
0	the movie was awful .  the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash .  i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old .  the martial arts are 'ok' ,  but when put next to the jackie chan movies and  " the matrix "  you're better off seeing one of those . 
0	whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball ,  especially her autobiography .  i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ,  ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi .  i could write a whole list of factual errors ,  but it would go on for pages .  in all ,  i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves .  if i were lucie arnaz and desi ,  jr .  ,  i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film .  the filmmakers tried hard ,  but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me . 
0	intergalactic criminal kol  ( ross hagen )  has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose .  but tonight there's going to be a jailbreak ,  and kol flees on a conveniently-placed escape pod and flies towards earth  ( which apparently is nearby )  .  there he confronts a group of  " teenagers "   ( who look thirty )  and a game warden  ( john phillip law )  ,  who help protect him from his worst nightmare .  .  .  the bounty hunter and executioner android  ( or more properly  " gynoid "  )  the alienator .   from the cover of the box ,  i was confident this was going to be an awful movie .  but ,  as awful as it turned out to be ,  it was a ton of fun as well  ( probably at least partially because i was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome )  .  the director  ( fred olen ray )  ,  who has specialized in making over one hundred low-grade films  ( most notably  " hollywood chainsaw hookers "  )  ,  does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects .  bonus :  p . j .  soles appears  ( as  " tara "  )  ,  obviously at a low point in her career .   sure ,  there's plot holes .  why are there hillbilly rednecks in california  ( allegedly los angeles county if i understood the warden correctly )  .  what's up with the space woman's tacky blouse ?  why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere ?  what the heck is  " quadrant 5 "  ?  how does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will short-circuit an android ,  yet land mines do virtually nothing ?  why does kol look like a drunk ,  native american football player with emphysema ?  and the lund guy  ( robert clarke )  .  .  .  does his character even have a point ?  does the game he plays with the captain have a point ?  does this movie have a point ?  but the biggest mystery is the android  ( or gynoid )  the alienator ,  played by teagan clive .  what is an  " alienator "  ?  why does it look like daryl hannah from  " blade runner "  ,  only much larger ?  because ,  see ,  if something is a cyborg ,  it's part human .  but if it's an android ,  it's all machine .  this was an android ,  so there was no reason to make it look human .  it could have looked like anything .  yet ,  the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker ,  with david bowie's hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much .  if you're going to make a female android ,  wouldn't the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in ?  mission not accomplished .  they say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes ,  but i think i found a huge exception .   if  " mystery science theater 3000 "  were still around today ,  this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get harangued .   beyond the butt-nasty alienator  ( sorry ,  teagan ,  female weight lifters are gross )  the film is alright .  maybe there's not much of a story and maybe the characters aren't really very interesting .  and maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason -- what use does a killer robot have with a deer ?  but overall ,  i actually liked the movie .  i won't be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest dvd copy  ( which i'm sure is just packed with amazing special features -- not )  .  but i consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future . 
1	 " the classic war of the worlds "  by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h .  g .  wells' classic book .  mr .  hines succeeds in doing so .  i ,  and those who watched his film with me ,  appreciated the fact that it was not the standard ,  predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year ,  e . g .  the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book .  obviously ,  everyone looks for different things in a movie .  those who envision themselves as amateur  " critics "  look only to criticize everything they can .  others rate a movie on more important bases , like being entertained ,  which is why most people never agree with the  " critics "  .  we enjoyed the effort mr .  hines put into being faithful to h . g .  wells' classic novel ,  and we found it to be very entertaining .  this made it easy to overlook what the  " critics "  perceive to be its shortcomings . 
1	i recently started watching this show ,  and i have to say that it really made me laugh .  you have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it ,  along with everything else .  some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead ,  among other things .  if you are going accept that ned can bring the dead back to life ,  you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show .  i couldn't help smiling after every episode i watched .  i really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch .  i absolutely love the narration ,  i think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show .  you can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones ,  you have to take everything as it's own entity .  definitely give it a chance ,  and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are . 
1	i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i ,  too found mary poppins  ( although i love julie andrews and dick vandyke )  to be silly and sacrine-sweet .  angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted .  it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch .  every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better .  you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other ,  despite their age and differences .  i thought the characters were well developed ,  especially charles who was at  " the age of not believing "  .  mary poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and cherish . 
0	an interesting change from the first one .  there was more mystery to this movie then the first .  even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer .  there are some good parts through the movie ,  the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up .  all up the movie is enjoyable .  the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film ,  norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel ,  but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother ,  things start going wrong .  perkins plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent ,  he swang that spade awfully hard . 
1	neil simon's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays .  felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original ,  the former being picky and neat ,  the latter being slovenly and loose .  simon would rewrite  ( less successfully )  the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple ,  with female roommates .  he made it a mixed couple  ( a woman with her daughter ,  and a man )  in the goodbye girls .  he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys ,  a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark ,  the aged ,  semi-retired vaudevillians .  here the  " apartment "  problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't stand each other .  the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie ,  and george burns as al .   in actuality ,  al probably does not think totally badly of willie - willie is pathological on the subject of al .  first al had little habits ,  such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter  " t "  ,  and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger ,  on stage .  secondly ,  al retired when his wife died .  willie was not ready to retire  ( and has been forcing his nephew and agent ,  ben  ( richard benjamin )  to try to get him jobs in commercials .  but willie can't remember lines unless they are funny ,  and keeps flubbing them .  so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial .   ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy .  he does bring al to see willie ,  and the sparks begin flying ,  as neither can figure out what the other is doing  ( and this is just in rehearsal .  on top of that ,  willie is insisting on changes  ( minor ones ,  but they throw off al )  such as saying  " enter !  !  !  "  when al knocks on the door .  the initial rehearsal is a failure ,  but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show .  the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al's neck ?   the three leads ,  matthau ,  burns ,  and benjamin ,  do very well with the one-liners ,  frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter  ( example :   " chest pains .  .  . i'm getting chest pains uncle willie .  every thursday i come here and get chest pains !  "   " so ,  come on fridays !  "  )  .  benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle ,  although matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult  ( he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville )  .  matthau has a little better grasp on reality  ( at first )  than burns ,  who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly .  burns is not senile - he takes things slowly .  but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement .   i call this a final  " voyage of discovery "  for our modern lewis and clark .  al and willie transcend their old skits ,  as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought .  even the irascible willie admits that al may be  ( to him )  a pain in the ass ,  but he was a funny man .   burns was not the original choice for the part of  " al lewis "   ( supposedly dale of the team smith and dale )  .  jack benny was .  benny probably would have done a good job ,  but ill-health forced him out  ( he died in 1975 )  .  burns  ( whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator )  turned in such a fine performance that he got the  " oscar "  for best supporting actor ,  and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god !  ;  oh god ,  you devil ;  and going in style .  he died in 1996 age 100 ,  having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan . 
0	since i'd seen the other three ,  i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series .  as a stand alone film ,  this movie is mediocre ;  but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece ;  it's a travesty .  the film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas ;  that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female .  it's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard ,  the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum .  the film does keep a thread with the original ,  which i won't reveal as despite being obvious ;  that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie .  the basics of the plot largely copy richard donner's original ,  and see a young couple adopt a child ,  which they name delia  ( not damiella or damiana ,  fortunately )  .  there's a big dog involved ,  and a child minder ;  and pretty soon ,  the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal ;  as she's menstruating at eight years old ,  and never suffered from any illnesses .  .  .   the first two sequels to the omen weren't bad at all ,  and the series really should have ended at number three .  i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line ,  as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made .  it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality ,  and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series .  the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl .  indeed ,  asia vieira does look like a little bitch ;  but she never convinces that she's the antichrist ,  as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable .  faye grant is given the meatiest role ,  and doesn't impress ;  while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time .  the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune ,  which of course has been ripped off from the original ;  and is overused .  on the whole ,  this film really isn't worth seeing ;  as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for ,  and doesn't even do justice to weaker second sequel . 
0	i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore .  it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already ,  and then it hit me .  .  .  .  . there's nothing new here !  i've heard that joke on seinfeld ,  i saw someone fall like that on friends ,  an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ,  ect .  none of the actors are interesting here either !  some were good on other shows  ( not here )  ,  and others are new to a profession they should have never entered .  avoid this stinker ! 
0	well ,  there's no real plot to speak of ,  it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex  ( which can sometimes be fun ,  too ,  but it's not in this case )  .  what else can i say about this .  .  .  ?  the action ,  when happening ,  is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper  ( one that has to be several miles high )  ,  but overall there's not much to recommend  " kite "  .  watch it if you want ,  but you're not missing much if you skip this one .  .  . 
0	a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular .  it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young ,  gay ,  black artist .   if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is .  it's well-directed ,  fairly well-written and  ( for the most part )  well-acted .  also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white .  also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes  ( not that explicit and no frontal )  .  still ,  i mostly hated this .   the film meanders all over the place ,  is full of unlikable characters  ( including the main protagonist )  and  ( this is the killer )  moves at a snails pace .  three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored .  but the director was there so i stayed .    his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete .  i really wish i could like this more  ( there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks )  but i can't .  unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this . 
0	the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater .  i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 ,  and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival .  it was an interesting premise ,  and seemed like it could go somewhere ,  but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything .  first of all ,  if you're going to do a musical ,  find someone with musical talent .  the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming .  the lyrics were terribly written ,  and when they weren't obvious rhymes ,  they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work .  and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical ,  right ?  not in this case .  luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time ,  but when they did sing it made me cringe .  especially when they attempted to sing in harmony .  and that just addresses the music .  some of the acting was pretty good ,  but a lot of the dialog was terrible ,  as well as most of the scenes .  they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes ,  or they just had a bad editor ,  because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film .  at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical .  i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again . 
1	i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one .  it deals with issues that most directors shy away from ,  my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my friend !   it's a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies .  it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight ,  it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of . 
1	i have a lot of time for all the columbo films ,  but this one in particular was extremely well written ,  and the solution at the end very effective .  however ,  my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film ,  between columbo and the murderer  ( i apologise if i've not remembered every detail of this exactly )  .  it's the most striking image of columbo i've seen :  the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered ,  and into the room beyond ,  which is lit up by daylight .  columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway  ( and us )  ,  contemplating the cupboard ,  and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light .  there's no sound .  the camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him .  he's deep in meditation ,  puffing gently on a cigar ,  swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks .  then the dialogue starts .  superb . 
0	---what happened to these unlikeable people .  alan arkin was ,  as usual ,  unfunny and just walks through the role .  the kids are all a mess .  mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way .  and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad ,  mean movie ?  if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction ,  and not try in any way to do better ,  this is your film .  all others ,  take a walk ,  read a book ,  or see something else .   jane
0	how sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be .  as soon as a few critics say something new is good  ( ie -  " shake-cam "  )  ,  everyone jumps on the bandwagon ,  as if they are devoid of independent thought .  this was not a good movie ,  it was a dreadful movie .  1 )  plot ?  - what plot ?  bourne was chased from here to there ,  from beginning to end .  that's the plot .  don't look for anything deeper than this .  2 )  cinematography ?  - do me a favor !  any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job  ( i am not exaggerating here )  .  this film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work .  the ridiculous shaking of every  ( i really do mean every )  scene will cause dizziness and nausea .  3 )  believable ?  - oh yes definitely .  this is a masterpiece of credibility .  i loved scenes about bourne being chased by  ( local )  police through the winding market streets of tangier .  - i've been to tangier .  even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse .  greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples .  4 )  editing ?  - i don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some !  - every scene is between 0 . 5 and 2 seconds .  i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the  " scenes "  flashing by .  5 )  directing ?  - hmmm .  this is an interesting aspect .  the film appears to have actually not had any directing .  more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script  ( all two pages )  at the cameramen and told to  " shoot a few scenes whilst drunk "  .  -  " don't worry boys ,  we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room "  .  the editor should be tarred ,  feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 )  not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne .  - putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor .  talk about stupid nincompoops .   ( whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor )  .   ( well ,  all men are evil ,  aren't they ?  - except for snags of course )  .  yes ,  this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity .  7 )  when the you-know-what finally hits the fan ,  good triumphs over evil  ( just like it always does ,  eh ?  )  and the would-be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger  ( yeah - right .  .  .  )  - at that very moment ,  the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger .  - how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath ?  wonders will never cease 8 )  don't worry ,  there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts .  well ,  we can't have nasty ,  politically incorrect ,  cia operatives going round shooting people ,  can we ?  how lovely to see a true to life p . c .  film of the noughties .  -------------the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish . 
0	**may contain spoilers**  a dude in a dopey-looking kong suit  ( the same one used in king kong vs .  godzilla in 1962 )  provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick .  kong is resurrected on mondo island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around .  the vampire-like villain is named dr .  who-funny ,  he doesn't look like peter cushing !  kong finally dukes it out with who's pride and joy ,  a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of magilla gorilla .  like many of honda's flicks this may have had some merit before american audiences diddled around with it and added new footage .  the rankin/bass animation company had a hand in this mess .  they should have stuck to superior children's programs like the little drummer boy . 
0	this movie is terrible .  carlitos way ( 1993 )  is a great film .  goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done .  this movie should be considered closer to the sting part2 or maybe speed zone .  remember those gems !  the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original .  this movie lacked everything de palma ,  pacino and penn worked so hard on .  there wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it .  i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder .  after i watched this s@*t fest movie ,  i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth .  after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery . 
1	in the film kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness  ( as well as general meaninglessness )  into the lives of various koreans ;  empty people seeking ways to fill themselves ,  enjoying the escapism of nature .  from the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters ;  we learn of their shortcomings and their desires ,  the overall complexity captured within human life  ( and yet the overal simplicity of humanity )  .  although the film is slow-moving ,  it can be very contemplative .  it does not force any ideas ,  but allows the ideas to come about themselves ,  it allows the concepts to reveal themselves .   the film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins ,  and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness ,  that love is often an act of selfishness ,  and the many mistakes that we make .  it is a look into everyday life ,  very well and beautifully done .   if you are looking for action or for intense drama ,  this is not the film for you .  however ,  if you enjoy honest ,  original ,  and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz ,  this is a great film to watch . 
1	saw this movie the first time while drunk at a motel in canada .  while flipping through channels came across the easy lube part .  my friend kept flipping but i told him to go back .  something about the name easy lube just didn't sound right .  watched the rest of the movie it was pretty damn funny .  jotted down a couple of names from the credits and got home to look it up .  turned out to be chevy chase's first movie .  i didn't remember him in it .  didn't remember much about it ,  so i rented it and gave it a second veiw .  it's pretty funny and quite graphic .  it's just like kentucky fried movie except not as funny .  love the fingers ,  easy lube ,  and i'm da f**kin' president parts .  dealers skit is pretty cool too .  i give it a 6 . 5 or 7 out of ten
1	silly ,  hilarious ,  tragic ,  sad ,  inevitable .   a group of down-and-outs team up with a  " seasoned "  crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty .  great idea .  .  . if you ignore the screwup factor .   nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change .  the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high .  although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn't new ,  i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way .  sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before .   very well done guys . 
0	how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long ?  it's terrible .  it makes me want to shoot someone .  it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie .  i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense .  i remember watching it when it first came out .  i thought ,  hey this could be interesting ,  then i found out how absolutely ,  insanely ,  ridiculously stupid it really was .  it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table .   please people ,  stop watching this and all other reality shows ,  they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create . 
1	i would love to comment on this film .  alas  ,  my search has always endeth in vain .  if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs ;  he would ,  without reservation ,  be eternally grateful .  .  .  .  .    blake wrote  " the road to excess is the path to wisdom "  ,  one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition  .  .  .  .  if not ,  i will have to replay the excellent mr russel's gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer  ( for better or for worse )  have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july 1816 whilst i ,  a fellow member of this melodious plot ,  rests his lonely case in solitude  .  .  . 
0	we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie .  basically ,  dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyes ( which i needed after i watched this movie )  .  apparently ,  neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation .  the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter ( too bad the screenwriters didn't have it )  .  by the way ,  does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world ,  neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times ?  why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine ?  disease ?  war ?  i mean come on !  doesn't neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has ?  ?  ?  finally ,  when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing ,  dancing and wrecking havoc ( basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip ,  i mean where else could you see a t-rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider-man ?  )  .  they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes (  ?  ?  ?  )  makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract .  why ?  why would kids sign a blank contract ?  ?  ?  screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some .  .  .  " brain-drain "  that he will let the children go .  the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb ,  give in and agree to his terms .  what ?  !  this is stupid !  they could have just menaced him ,  made him drop the contract ,  eaten it then walked off with the kids .  i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad ,  which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him .  oh yeah ,  that's not violent at all !  we're back makes no sense ,  it's not fun ,  it's goofy ,  it's stupid ,  poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film .  even for a kid's film .  .  .  this is bad . 
1	mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie .  don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie ;  it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat .  we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing ,  he is a true spiritual leader .  only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones .  a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example .  according to the movie ,  he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from ,  but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father .  when things went wrong with harilall ,  mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy .    had it been any other parents ,  they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet .  mahatma didn't do that ,  he is true leader who leads by example . 
1	i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem .  ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious .  .  .  well you'll see .  maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary/neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that beams through in this picture .  she creates a fine portrayal of a warm ,  witty and real person who in the long run .  .  . well .  .  .   molden and newhart as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own .    robert morley and ceasar romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romero's case ustinov is extending a helping hand of work .    this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it's problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost .  .  . i say almost .   let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly ,  forgiving and deeply involving plot in this picture . 
1	 " once in the life "  is a very good movie .  however it's not good for everybody ,  due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations .  the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic ,  believable way the  " life "  in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important .  this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs  ( however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue .  on video it's ok )  .  there is a little overplay sometimes ,  but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie ,  which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise ,  notably in the time/action management .  the characters ,  even though not simple ,  are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them .  by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack  ( b .  marsalis )  .  if you're not too prude ,  you should enjoy seeing that movie once ,  twice ,  three times .  i rated the movie 9/10 . 
1	definitely one of the most witty and twisted who-dunnit i ever seen .  christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair .    very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings .  the minimalist feel works for the whole picture .   my only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd .  i own the fullscreen version  ( which proves i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation )  but a awesome deluxe or 'special' edition would most surely get my cash . 
1	house of games is spell binding .  it's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens .  there are few movies i've seen that can grip you so quickly .  from the opening scene this movie just gets you .   i'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don't read anymore if you don't want to know .   i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen-bar none .  from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed .   lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection ,  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately .  joe mantegna was also wonderful .  the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices .  i also loved the way the movie was filmed ,  in that grainy ,  surreal type of way ,  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was .   there were a few movies i've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really ,  house of games is completely different in it's way .  margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet ,  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying .  you know something's going to happen but you have no idea what .  and just when you think you've guessed what the  " something "  is ,  you realize you haven't even scratched the surface .  .  .  .   house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature .  the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well .  as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters ,  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it .  it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion .   in closing ,  i'd rank this 10 of 10 ,  call it  ( although not my absolute favorite film ,  pretty high on the list )  ,  most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  " twists "  i've ever seen as well .  although i love all types and genres of movies ,  when it comes to movies of the human psyche ,  it really doesn't get much better then this .  see this movie . 
0	if i hadn't been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes .  and even then i admit i fast forwarded through parts .  the '63 film version was vastly superior in all regards .  yes ,  i've read this one is more faithful to the original play ,  but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in '63 !  it's overlong ,  it drags ,  the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative .  the version of  " kids "  in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor .  in this version the kim is way too old ,  the conrad is *absolutely horrible* to behold  ( when someone ripped his shirt off him i shuttered in disgust .  .  . the director of this version has no idea what sexy is .  )  .  this conrad can't dance ,  can't sing  ( he can't even stay in tune )  and is simply repulsive .  if elvis presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began .  as for the other actors ,  well i kept waiting for alexander's toupee to fall off as he danced and daly was totally over acting as momma .  see stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing .  this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time . 
0	in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego ,  only beaten by the new king kong movie .  superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights .  brandon routh was the worst superman i've ever seen ,  from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat .  he looks just silly wearing the costume .  but enough about him ,  kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane ,  she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter ,  but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl .  the plot was weak and predictable  ( wow ,  he is actually supermans son ,  who would have ever thought .  .  .  .  )  and the acting was horrible .  this movie has one good thing going for it ,  and it's name is kevin spacey .  his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie .  what this movie needed was the cast of  " lois and clark "   ( except kevin spacey of course )  and a different story .  i watched this movie after watching  " the hills have eyes "  and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that . 
0	the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between . but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable .    but krista allen really rocked in the movie  . her voice was so seducing and sexy . the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do . krista really is one of the best in such roles . she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes , which is the interesting part of the movie .   burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star . he could have chosen a better script than this . ireally think he did for money . 
0	fot the most part ,  this movie feels like a  " made-for-tv "  effort .  the direction is ham-fisted ,  the acting  ( with the exception of fred gwynne )  is overwrought and soapy .  denise crosby ,  particularly ,  delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card .  only one thing makes this film worth watching ,  and that is once gage comes back from the  " semetary .  "  there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone ,  and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason .  it is absolutely bone-chilling .  this film only does one thing right ,  but it knocks that one thing right out of the park .  worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so . 
0	first of all .  .  .  .  .   what the hell ?  why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing ,  offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch .    what the crap is funny about a dog being injured ,  a grandma getting her head knocked off .  .  . a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom ?  what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick .  anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny ,  should not even be allowed to walk the earth .    but from what i hear its not even offensive .  .  . so .  .  . they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage .  .  . and they cant even pull that off . 
0	what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm ?  homeless people answer to no one .  they have no mortgages ,  rent payments or idiot bosses .  homeless people don't have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments .  but ,  give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and ,  suddenly ,  they have to worry about entering the rat race ,  buying gas for transportation ,  paying insurance on their car ,  and working for someone else .  they get a chance to be a  " productive citizens .  "  this film was about as exploitive as a film can be .  it's a way for the rich and middle-class sheeple to say  " see what happens when you try to help the poor ?  "  and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance .   why not a film that asks ,   " what happens when you take away everything a rich man has ?  " 
1	if you have any clue about jane austen´s production ,  you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels :  marriage ,  marriage and marriage !  in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring ,  but i like austen´s characters ,  because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma .  the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow ,  she´s very good in her leading role .  also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious . 
0	on the way back from imc6  ( san jose ,  california )  ,  all five  ( mind you ,  three of us hardcore kamal fans )  of us had reached a unanimous verdict ;  vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday .  not to mention ,  we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year .   i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan  ( on vijay tv )  .  he said something like ,   " tamizh cinema'la photography ,  editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay ,  direction ,  acting'la innum namba munnera'la "   ( tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing ,  but we have hardly improved ,  when it comes to screenplay ,  direction and acting "  )  .  while you're watching vv ,  those words ring very true .   now ,  here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie :   1 .  harris jeyaraj  2 .  harris jeyaraj  3 .  harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here ,  but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his  ( remember 'anniyan' ,  'ghajini' )  with the jarring cacophony ,  he bills as background music .  the next time i have an eardrum transplant ,  he's paying for it .    4 .  songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice .  the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them .   5 .  a short gone too far .  vv at best is fit to be a short story ,  not a 2 hour plus  " thriller "  .  to use a cliché here ,  like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on ;  only in this case you don't want it to .  the later part of a movie feels like a big drag .   6 .  kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing .  there's no reason you would root for them to make it together .  in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie ,  they make a good irritant to the narration .  hate to say this ,  but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali' .   7 .  kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us ;  and it isn't new either .  he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae' .  it's simply gets on the nerve .  imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us .  he doesn't leave it at the immigration either ,  he offers doses of advice to his men  ( bewildered tn cops from keeranor ,  sathoor and beyond )  in chaste kamanglish  (  " wha we hav here is plain bad police wok "  )  ,  of course with nauseating effect .   8 .  logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale .  gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense .  which d . c . p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after !  the scene inside the theatre was so bad ,  towards the climax ;  we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq .   " is he stupid ,  can't he just use his siren or lights ?  "   ( on a busy madras road ,  kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude !  )  .   " can't he just use his gun ?  "   (  " the guy on a bike "  starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time )  .  i'm not voting in favour of the later ,  but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside .   9 .  gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped ,  their throats getting slashed ,  more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity ,  i would sit at home and rather watch a  " police report "  or  " kuttram "  .  the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story ,  not overwhelm it !  somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions  ( rapes ,  murders )  are and what the mainstay  ( story )  is !   10 .  even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head . 
0	somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed ,  zombie-like killers .  the  " guinea pigs "  for the experiment are scantily-clad ,  nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons .  this movie is awful ,  atrocious ,  and amazingly bad .  it has little to no logic in the script .  you really will have trouble following what is going on .  it has no special effects .  the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen .  and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair ( looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it )  named george that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica ( the leading  " actress "  )  .  throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic ,  sophmoric utterings of this puppet .  but wait .  .  . you also get loads of softcore ,  unerotic ,  barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys .  all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place .  none of the actors are good .  there are just varying degrees of bad .  the gore and  " horror "  aspects are especially ineptly filmed .  the film really looks like an adolescent put it together .  no coincidence henry sala ,  the director by name but not by trade ,  has not made another film .  i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid ,  silly ,  dreck !  and how bout the ending ?  what happened ?  if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out .  all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore ! 
0	there are two kinds of characters on the shield :  people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing ,  and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes ,  and everyone's only hope .  more than any other show ,  the shield is about hypocrisy and self-delusion .  unfortunately ,  the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes ,  and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again ,  making fools out of all of their peers .   the show boasts excellent camera-work .  the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb .  it really is a work of art to see .  unfortunately the story is a cartoony ,  overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence ,  rape ,  and lies .   the hero ,  who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme ,  is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character ,  always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds  ( anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes )  ,  automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show ,  always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice ,  and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications .  if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing ,  and someone gets hurt because of his actions ,  he always blames the suspicious cop ,  regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause .  every time .   like 24 ,  this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season .  boring ,  unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody ,  perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups .   most disappointing though ,  is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth ,  to and away form the characters on whims .  sometimes ,  they want us to see shane as the enemy .  sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul .  sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous ,  sexual dynamo .  sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold .  sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel .  then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane ,  that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic .   none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want .  once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends ,  that's it .  it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth .  but then ,  it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station ,  right under everyone's noses . 
1	everyone plays their part pretty well in this  " little nice movie "  .  belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently ,  but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better .  the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have ,  not the ones we do not or cannot have .  if u can get this movie on video for around $10 ,  it´d be an investment ! 
1	i would say for it's time ,  this movie was awesome .  .  . and yes if you have no desire to become a christian ,  then why bother watching it .  i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving .  i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series .  .  . they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people .  i think in order to actually judge this movie ,  you should see it ,  ,  , there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken .  .  . don't use our comments to judge ,  see the movie for yourself !  !  god will bless you if that is why you are watching them . 
1	i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov 2006 in london  (  i was not really into cream until now !  !  )  . it was through a high end arcam system , it sounded great with dts . i had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched . the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd . it does not matter what type of music you like , this one will definitely grow on you . it's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again . even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days ,  as these old rockers do . 
0	a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion ,  to make a low-budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century .  even with warnings by the caretaker ,  the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house .  one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead ,  and use some of the passages from it for their script .  but in doing so ,  when red they raise a ghoul from its grave .   boring ,  confusing and tacky all rolled up into one ,  equals this penniless midnight horror production .  what feels like an eternity ,  it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas .  even though director paul harrison's clunky ,  tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie ,  moody and atmospheric set-pieces .  but laziness did set it early .  the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest .  nor is it fun .  think of bob clark's  " children shouldn't play with dead things  ( 1972 )  "  ,  and now we've got older actors in the part .  however i found  " seven corpses "  to be inferior .  the script early on has some cutting wit abound ,  before it ends up being drab ,  predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities .  the cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either ,  but the mansion's dreary ,  dark appearance had a creepy air to it .  performances from a recognizable b-cast is mainly rigid .  john carradine in small part mainly lurks about .  john ireland plays a hot-headed director ,  faith domergue's washed-up actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up .  the slow grinding premise is crossed between  " ten little indians "  and your usual zombie set-up .  however its not all that engaging ,  even with its occult and supernatural edge .  hell they even throw in some graveyard action ,  with no prevail .  when the rotting ghoul makes its appearance finally ,  but a bit late .  it does get a little better ,  if very baffling .  just like the inspired opening ,  the ending is deliciously downbeat .  to bad in between ,  it constantly drags .  continuity in many scenes comes across non-existent ,  and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier  ( but indeed poorly executed )  in the movie they're making ,  then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears .  the generic music score flounders on with its shuddery ,  but frank gothic cues ,  and the camera-work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination .  shoot and frame .  shoot and frame .  job done .  that's a wrap . 
0	or :  it's a bird  ?  it's a plane  ?  no ,  look .  .  .  it's a disaster  !  or :  no need to look up in the sky .   or :   (  .  .  .  ok ,  that's enough .  )  if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record ,  he failed .  the sr structure can't do this ,  the dark and restricted color scheme  ( i would call it  " wishi-washi "  )  ,  the boring usual dialogs ,  the clown with advanced alien technology ,  the missing fun and magic ,  etc .  makes the movie completely disappointing .   it simply doesn't work .   the main thing at a character like superman is ,  that he is a superhero .  that's the core ,  the most important thing .   love trouble and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2 : 40 long superman movie ,  not the whole time .   because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore .  it's like a  ( and in this case a very bad and boring )  social study ,  where every 30 minutes a person flies around .   that's a big difference .   this movie is a joke .  holy skywalker ,  this is superman ,  so give us supervillains ,  superaction and the most important thing ,  superfun .   we want entertainment  !  singer ,  if you want to make a 2 : 40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people  ?  then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake .   they say :  superman returns .  and then ,  supersadlysoftie stands in the door .   maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite ,  but one bad movie can't do this .  don't give up ,  they plan a sequel .  .  .   next time singer  ( and warner brothers )  ,  make a superhero movie ,  not a depressive superlame soap ,  or let it be .  a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic .   this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover .  yes ,  technically there are all sorts in ,  yes ,  there is a lot of small talks ,  there are a few jokes ,  a view action scenes ,  etc ,  but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality .   it's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live .   the ridiculous cast strategy  ( cast them young as possible ,  so we can make sequels in the next 25 years )  gives the rest .  kate bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter ,  she's looking like 19 .  superman was full five years away ,  so he slept with her 6 years ago ,  so she was 16 ,   ( looking like 13 )  and a daily planet reporter ,  wroting  " i spend a night with superman "  .  warner brothers ,  that's too much .   routh is not so bad ,  he is playing a little bit wooden ,  but the whole movie is wooden ,  so .  .  .   ?  !  temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey .  the rest ,  forget it .  even spacey ,  this is not his terrain .   reeve/hackman/kidder were acting so easy ,  with fun .  what a difference .   the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too .  what the hell should that be  ?  the problem here is ,  they mean this serious ,  not as a joke .  next time spiderman or batman or ironman falls and rises like jesus or angels  ?  or they speak with god directly .  why not  ?  they are superheroes ,  saving human lives every day .  so at least one talk with god every week should be possible .  .  .  oh my god .   maybe this was not the real announced movie ,  instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe .   for the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history .  not only because of the money .   i understand how difficult it  ( maybe )  was to create and transport some messages or feelings ,  but showing lone ,  lost and sadly people isn't new and thousands of movies or tv-shows did it better ,  in very old or new ones like magnolia .  and the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman ,  sorry ,  superman of course .   singer and wb ,  that's simply nothing .  in fact it's even more than nothing ,  it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for  ( comic/superhero )  movies and steals us three hours of our life .   mrs .  smilla's little brother .   ( very angry and green like the hulk .  ) 
1	it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it .  i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing ,  but an ordinary sex-drama so .  .  .  .  it's a pscyho-sexual thriller ,  in which nothing is what it seems .  it features emmanuelle seigner ,  no stranger to the genre  ( and to nudity )  in which her husband ,  polanski ,  had directed her .  and a creepy performance  ( did i say creepy/yes creepy )  from toreton  ( bernard tavernier's actor )  .  it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski  ( better than bitter moon )  ,  like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller  ( i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques )  ,  but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage  ( eyes without a face ,  the godfather of dr .  phibes and more )  .  a gem  !  i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing . 
1	this film is a great fun .  i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends .  i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world !  i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time .  but they all thanked me and loved the movie .  you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie !    i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri's level ,  but no where near the same size ring .  he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a . a .  group where everyone trusts everyone else .  he would  " sponsor "  only people who seemed very well to do .  who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k ( in 1987 when that was real money )  after being in town for only 1 month .  his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober .  he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face .   the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor .  but i don't want to give anything away .   i just found this one night on a late night movie channel ,  " showtim "  i think .  this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown .  just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them a thing .  it is a very entertaining film ,  it moves quickly and never bores you .   this should be a international classic for all time .  i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top .  time will be very good to this film .  i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet , in some ways that makes the surprises even better .   the director and editor were fantastic .  they deserved winning the best documentary .   just watch this film !

0	the supernatural ,  vengeful police officer is back for a third installment ,  this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop .  standard stalk and slash picture ,  yet well acted and directed ,  thus making it oddly interesting and watchable ,  though the violence isn't for the squeamish  ( especially the director's cut which was originally given an  " nc-17 "  rating )  .   *1/2 out of ****
0	'the vampire bat' is definitely of interest ,  being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930's ,  but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise .   the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century ,  where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals .  there is a very similar feel to james whale's 'frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwill's dr niemann character ,  complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement .   the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton herman  ( dwight frye )  ,  thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one .   this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co-starred  ( also 'doctor x' and 'the mystery of the wax museum' )  and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements .  taken in context though ,  'the vampire bat' is still weak and derivative .   all we are left with is a poor-quality frankenstein imitation ,  with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans .  but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the 'blondie' films a few years later . 
0	i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time :  darklight .   the gist of the film- lilith was adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam's equal and refused to submit to him .  see ,  i took those words straight from the script .  then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film ,  the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do !  she ends the film under the control of the faith- an all male group !   other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful .  apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film ,  there was nothing original about darklight . 
0	this crew-versus-monsta has been done a hundred times ,  sometimes better .  this one was pretty slow-moving  ;  only the monster's resurrection was really worthwhile .  attempts at character developments gets botched by routine .  yeah ,   " routine "  is the word .  went straight to video in france .  no wonder
1	young mr . lincoln is a poetic , beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history .  henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about .  it is perhaps the actors best performance . watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching-mob . alice brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman . most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom , and there lies the only negative thing i can say about this movie . most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand . but i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark .  supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good . 
1	zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's  ( shintaro katsu )  own production company ,  this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series ,  though it is by no means weak overall .  it tells of our hero coming across two towns ,  rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy ,  violence and no little interest ,  all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks .  it is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion ,  but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff .  the helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character ,  upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure ,  zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions ,  whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor .  its a harsh world ,  with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting ,  though things aren't as rousing as they could be .  shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi ,  mixing wisdom ,  deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability ,  while solid work comes also from rentarô mikuni and an effectively baleful kô nishimura  ( later to appear as katsu's superior  " snake "  magobei in the hanzo trilogy )  as the two main bosses in the film .  there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman .  the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events ,  there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost ,  meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be ,  emotional impact is lost also .  the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto ,  though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way ,  without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments .  still ,  i enjoyed this one ,  it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment ,  a good story and decent doses of zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool .  recommended for fans of the series ,  and a reasonable entry point ,  classy stuff though not a true great . 
0	the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists  .  it should actually be called dino crap .   there is nothing good about this movie .  .  even the actors are not worth a penny .  don't waste your time watching this movie .  the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie  .  i mean isn't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie  ?  the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut-and-paste stuff .  and its the same old story  .  man plays god  .  creates some creature  .  it escapes and is happy eating people  .  and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it  .  bla bla .  .  u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
0	this is the worst movie i ever paid to see and with the exception of  " they saved hitler's brain "  the worst movie i have ever seen period .  when this movie came out i was a big fan of snl and sctv and therefore was anticipating what i thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the tv improv shows must deal with .    the writers must have thought we will throw in some grossness ,  some flatulence jokes ,  some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side splitting laughable comedy .  the game show skits are nothing more than cheap unimaginable take offs on let's make a deal with stupid grossness .  the sit com take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad high school humor .  the stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for seasame street .  the la subway skit was bland humor using tasteless bloodiness .  the french chef walking around blind constantly uttering  " there is no difference "  with a french accent was ,  well you get my point .   the only funny skit involved chevy chase which lasted for a whole minute .  this means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie .  oh yea i've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high .  well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's .  if the inept writers were stoned it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine .  there were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when i saw this movie .  of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was . 
0	i rented this flick for one reason tom savini ,  i respect his work but this was a real let down ,  i had horrible clichés ,  half of the film was naked women so called  " fallen angels "  running around trying to act scary ,  oh and then there was the occasional  " blair witch "  black and white motion sicken camera scenes .  tom's character was really awful ,  horrible script .  and you got to love these lines they use .   " is anyone there ,  who is out there ,  this isn't funny "  no but your acting was .  i wish i could give this flick a 0 !  oh the names of the characters .  judd ,  molly ,  ally ,  emilio ,  but they did leave out anthony ,  the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting . 
0	there is only one problem with this website ,  you can't give a negative rating .  additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie .  i say he was being too nice .  a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie ,  and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire .  this is absolutely terrible ,  2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back .  after watching 5 minutes ,  myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining .  half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny .  it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more ,  he should go and buy a rope .  and to the actors in this flick ,  i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again .  in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence . 
1	`the united states of kiss my ass'  house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller .  it stars lindsay crouse as best-selling psychiatrist ,  margaret ford ,  who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide .  in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place ,  house of games .   the gambler mike  ( played excellently by joe mantegna )  turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty .  he offers crouse's character a deal ,  if she is willing to sit with him at a game ,  a big money game in the backroom ,  he'll cancel the patients debts .  the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work  ( gaining the trust of others )  and a fascinating relationship begins .  what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control ,  is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs david mamet .   in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring ,  however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings ,  not the direction .  in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads  ( showy and distracting )  but mainly as is the case with much of mamet's work ,  it is the dialogue ,  which grips you and slowly draws you into the film .  no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words .  everyone bluffs and double bluffs ,  which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order .  this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension .  house of games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie .  with lindsay crouse we have the middle-class ,  well-to-do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite ,  the working class of america earning a living by `honest' crime .   the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema .  and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for ,  it's stunning .   an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings .  9/10
1	the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot ,  as we have seen so many  " super-people "  movies these years .  .  .  and in fact ,  i really liked it ,  as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect .  uma thurman performed as average in g-girl's role .  surprisingly ,  i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen  ( like in the beginning of kill bill )  .  luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman ,  i could really get into his situation .  if you want a light touch of fun ,  you should definitely watch g-girl's and average matt's adventures ,  especially to cheer up your partner .  7/10 in my collection . 
1	i very much enjoyed  " the revolution will not be televised "  .  it gave me ,  once again ,  a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed .   it is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades ,  if not centuries .  however ,  when their coup failed ;  after the interim government dissolved the supreme court ,  and the constitution ,  and the ombudsman ,  and the electoral boards ,  and all civil rights ,  no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them .  they haven't even gone to jail .  the major plotters are living in florida ,  carrying on .  and the protection that they had was the  " bolivarian constitution "  passed by a large majority of the venezuelan people .  it is not only history that bites .  democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose .  and in venezuela it is loose . 
0	up to this point ,  gentle rain was the movie i found the worst in history .  it has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster' out of asia .  it has one  " star "  and it is john rhys davies .  he is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling ,  magical flying baddie he is cast here .  the rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play .  no clichés were missed in the dialogue ,  and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible .   it is fairly easy to see that somebody in asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at .  or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit .  my guess is that any career with this movie in it's credential  do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie .  a hundred thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey .   the one funny scene was unintentional .  the brother of the king appears on the scene .  the king ?  a handsome ,  older ,  short asian actor .   ( bad actor .  )  the brother ?  a six foot european .   ( also a bad actor .  )  no excuses were made for this .  they just expected us not to notice that this poor man's jet li's brother was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap dimestore  " injun "  wig right out of an old western movie from the forties . 
0	this movie features an o . k .  score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr .  hackenstein .  the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the  " special effects "  that this is a low budget movie .  there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist ,  horror/comedy ,  or low budget movies .  not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either .  this movie is simply here .  anne ramsey and phillis diller are nothing to get excited about as well .  if you are curious as i was and can actually find this ,  you will realize the truth of the one line summary . 
0	it is a good film for kids who love dogs .  it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up de vil .  the basic plot is the same as the first movie .  the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog .  the bird talks like a human ( eric idle of monty python )  and barks like a dog .  it is the comedy that the film needed more of .  see it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney . 
1	i am not going to spoil the contents to anyone ,  who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by kay pollak .   a world famous conductor brilliantly played by michael nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village .  the villagers ,  who has followed the genius in silence ,  are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness .   each role in this movie ,  has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words ,  a symphony of love .   not love in the sense of relationship ,  but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters ,  each revealing their own present story ,  their needs ,  their skeletons ,  desires and much more .   i shall not forget to mention ,  the two main parts played by frida hallgren and michael nyqvist ,  whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback .  they touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves .   michael nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup ,  in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic .  and fantastic it became from start to end ,  not one second less or more than enough ,  you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more .   to this day ,  definitely one of the best movies i have had the pleasure of watching . 
1	one used to say ,  concerning nathaniel hawthorne ,  that his failures were more interesting than his successes .  i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald-eddy's pictures .  and especially this one .    it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie :  it's kitsch ,  the script ,  because of censorship ,  sounds inconsistent yet ,  this movie gets also some good points :  good rodgers-hart's music  (  " i married an angel "  ,   " tira tira tira la "  )  ,  good acting with e . e . horton and reginald owen .    anyway ,  if you may dislike it ,  you can't forget it .  this strange movie actually leaves a very strong ,  dreamlike ,  impression ,  and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days ,  maybe for weeks .  why ?  in the thirties and the beginning of the forties ,  movies didn't have the same mean than today :  it aimed ,  like a dream ,  to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality .  of all the the dream-movies that was made ,  in that time ,  this one stands as particularly powerful .   in short ,  let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie ,  is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad .  to watch it ,  like you would watch a dream . 
1	this is such a fantastic movie ,  a western about a self-concerned man  ( jimmy stewart )  going up to the klondike for gold .  on the way ,  he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska  ( john mcintire ,  giving a wonderfully evil performance )  ,  whom he hassles back .  mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town ,  which is ,  unfortunately ,  the only way back to the states .  the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town .  ruth roman ,  for instance ,  who has come with stewart and his two companions  ( jay c .  flippen and walter brennen ,  who plays stewart's best friend )  ,  builds a saloon  ( a hollywood front for a whorehouse )  and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business .  she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up ,  too .  in 1953 ,  jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre ,  the naked spur .  the far country is just the tiniest bit less ,  and it contains 99 . 9% of what made that film so special without ,  of course ,  feeling like a cheap copy .  like the naked spur ,  the far country boasts beautiful ,  on-location cinematography .  the landscape is gorgeous .  stewart gives one of his best performances  ( nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 ,  rear window )  .  i suppose it could be considered cliche ,  as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end .  still ,  stewart plays it so damn well ,  he makes this character very human .  and the supporting performances are universally fantastic .  in addition to those i've mentioned ,  the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good .  and i ought to single out walter brennen ,  as well .  he seems to have specialized in playing best friends .  his relationship with stewart is very touching ,  since he is ,  at first ,  the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man .  the screenplay is very well written ,  and mann's direction is impeccable .  a masterpiece .  10/10 . 
1	this musical is decidedly mixed ,  and none of the elements really fit together ,  but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable .  the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel ,  but none of its virtues ,  though he co-wrote the script .  the songs ,  though charming ,  have nothing to do with this particular film ,  and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot ,  even by pre-oklahoma standards .  burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently ,  but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points .   there are a few high points .  reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie ,  and stops mugging like a silent actor .  and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse ,  though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied . 
0	i saw the mst3k version of  " deathstalker iii "  and loved the movie so much -- even  " unmystied "  -- that i decided to watch the entire series of  " deathstalker "  films .  i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh .   nothing about  " deathstalker i "  was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it !  too much ugliness and nudity .  i guess either  " ds 3 "  was a much cleaner production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar ,  i . e .  stupid and carefree and simple .  i was wrong .  even at $6 . 99 it seemed a waste of money .  i didn't even open  " ds 2 "  as i will return it tomorrow .  now i'll probably just throw away this dvd as i can't return it and no one wants it -- including myself !  so really ,  don't bother with this one .  even the nudity  ( lots of it ,  btw )  is uninspiring and icky . 
0	i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas .  having reserved a special slot for it last night ,  i sat down to watch it with my daughter  ( aged 17 and a film studies student )  ,  with chocolates of course ,  in eager anticipation .  we love jane austin .   after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk .  the shaky camera shots and angles ,  general poor cinematography ,  direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied .  despondent ,  we viewed on .   anne ,  played by sally hawkins ,  looked oddly and with no particular purpose ,  directly at the camera on several occasions ,  breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'i'll find you' stalking fashion .   poor rupert penry-jones ,  who played captain wentworth ,  did his best with the script and direction ,  bless him .  i hope they paid him well ,  however ,  as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall ,  drenching him and his co-actor .  they were nearly swept out to sea .  health and safety would have had a field day !  poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line .  presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene .  anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place .   other than mr .  penry-jones ,  alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head's unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott .   towards the long-awaited end of the film ,  captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie .  it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being .  in contrast ,  anne ran ,  hyper-ventilating ,  from pillar to post in search of the good captain who ,  in the meantime ,  had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told ,  in the course of only three or four minutes ,  without even having worked up a sweat .   we experienced none of anne's charms crossing the screen .  indeed ,  we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain ,  spineless ,  opinion-less anne and why someone ,  anyone ,  did not tell mean ,  winging sir walter to just shut the heck up .   the crucial kiss ,  normally our favourite girlie moment ,  was painfully drawn out .  as they moved in closer ,  anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met .  eww !    the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been .   what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story ,  filmed in some of england's finest scenery .   sorry jane . 
0	 ( aka :  trinity is still my name )  this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box-office success of they call me trinity ,  only this time joseph e .  levine and avco-embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well .  too bad they didn't get very far since the hill/spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u . s .  ,  and this largely boring ,  drawn-out film doesn't help it out any .   trinity and bambino swear to their dying father  ( harry carey jr .  )  that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other .  they later get involved with arms-traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery ,  and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents .  it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes ,  especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves .  and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well .   the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro-like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good .  not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might .   the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long .  it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here .  in fact ,  i lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through .  the dvd is also terrible ,  with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky .   a big step down from the previous film .   4 out of 10
1	a lot of people don't think branagh's hamlet film is all that good ,  but i must admit i think it is splendid .  like virtually every production of shakespeare ,  it has problems and it has had to make hard choices ,  not all of which work out .  the thing about the  " secret doors everywhere "  ,  for instance ,  simply doesn't work .  that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to ,  which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming .  this is the biggest problem with this production .  and while it's a biggie ,  i'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem .  almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully .  all right ,  so branagh is a mite too old for the title role .  and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced .  and he gets too hysterical at times .  but that's it .  no other complaints .  even with these faults ,  i think this version is a seminal one ,  and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be ,  it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be .  we get the complete text of the longest version of the play ,  innovatively and expensively brought to the screen ,  mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with .  but in a staging of shakespeare ,  it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language .  for that ,  one must delve into the print versions of the plays .   all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic  ( incl .  jack lemmon )  .  julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever ,  and even the american actors are astounding ,  esp .  charlton heston as the player king - who would have thought it ?  !   ( a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage ,  and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud ,   " this is terrible !  "  ,  heston reportedly retorted right from the stage :   " well ,  i didn't write this crap !  "  of course it may not be true ,  but it's a funny story - and if true ,  a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here .  )  robin williams as  " young ozric "  is perhaps not young enough for the part ,  but he makes it a comical one ,  which is warranted .   overall it is a very well-produced version ,  with most of the key scenes being ,  to my mind ,  supremely memorable .  of course ,  i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare  ( and around the same time as luhrmann's formidable romeo+juliet )  ,  and it made a great impression on me ,  which must account for some of my fondness for it .   all things considered ,  i must pronounce branagh's hamlet to be my favorite one ,  with derek jacobi's 1980 bbc version a close second .  i probably like branagh's shakespeare work more than most ,  finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer ,  with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text .  in the world of shakespeare acting ,  the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh ,  and while olivier is the superior actor ,  branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice ,  and transforms it into churlish ,  easy-going ,  populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity .  branagh ,  i believe ,  brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seen .   and so ,  10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet . 
1	i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature .  i love all of jason steele's comedy .  it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable .  i love indie films and this one is just great .  the plot is strange but very funny .  this short film is about a talking spatula named edward .  the order of the events are a bit jumbled ,  making this film very interesting to watch .  at first you see edward fighting the spoons ,  but then the focus changes to earlier in his life .  this is a silly movie ,  but of course ,  it's still great .  i highly recommend that you watch this film at www . spatulamadness . com or www . filmcow . com .  it's very funny .  the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway .  it'll only take 16 minutes of your time ,  and it's free .  go watch spatula madness ! 
0	if you hate redneck accents ,  you'll hate this movie .  and to make it worse ,  you see patrick swayze ,  a has been trying to be a redneck .  i really can't stand redneck accents .  i like billy bob thornton ,  he was good in slingblade ,  but he was annoying in this movie .  and what kind of name is lonnie earl ?  how much more hickish can this movie get ?  the storyline was stupid .  i'm usually not this judgemental of movies ,  but i couldn't stand this movie .  if you want a good billy bob thornton movie ,  go see slingblade .   my mom found this movie for $5 . 95 at wal mart .  .  . figures .  .  . i think i'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas .  it could just be that i can't stand redneck accents usually ,  or that i can't stand patrick swayze .  maybe if patrick swayze wasn't in it .  i didn't laugh once in the movie .  i laugh at anything stupid usually .  if they had shown someones fingers getting smashed ,  i might have laughed .  people's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh . 
1	this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn't stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight  ( despite the fact that i've seen all the episodes previously )  .  i've always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience .  i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time .  .  .  i can't say that about many tv shows .  .  .  can you ?  this show is finally something new and interesting and  ( most importantly )  funny !  this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out .  you owe it to yourself to watch this show .  .  .  i predict a long run for this series .  .  .  and just to be clear ,  the people who are offended by this show just don't get it .  .  .  perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it .  .  .  they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand .  anyone who uses the word  " bigot "  in reference to silverman ,  or who claims that she only aims to  " shock "  .  .  .  is way off the mark .  .  .  she's exactly the opposite ;  just google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights ,  etc .  if you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints ,  you don't get it .  and if you don't get it ,  do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity .  .  . 
1	i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently .  i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day .  if it is in a theater near you .  .  .  go !  it's not a funny feel-good movie - it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie .   the director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into the heart ,  mind and hurts of hagar little by little .  at first ,  her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense .  as her story unfolds ,  she becomes someone you can understand .  as in life .  .  .  understanding brings empathy .  i found her likable by the end of the movie - particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake .   hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world .  her youngest son ,  john ,  who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare .   it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie .  she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno .  it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability .  if you loved her in juno ,  you'll love her in the stone angel .   of course ,  there is ellen burnstyn as hagar .  there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played .  never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn - i always and only thought of hagar .  she swept me into her character - hook ,  line and sinker .   kari skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada's most cherished authors is impressive .  she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman ,  hagar - the stone angel . 
1	in some ways ,  the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried's death ,  but it also loses some of that film's greatness .  the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first ,  which is quite amazing .  the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through ,  until ,  that is ,  you get to the climactic battle scenes ;  only the iliad's are better .  lang and harbou embellished the huns .  the poet-compiler of the nibelungenlied didn't know a hun from his right ball ,  and as a result they are ,  more or less ,  the same as the burgundians in custom .  for example ,  although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen  ( which is kriemhild's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him )  ,  when she gets to hunland ,  the first thing she does is go to mass .  the huns here are clearly heathens ;  they're almost like caveman .  the depiction of them is hilarious ,  especially verbal ,  the jester ,  who has two marvelous scenes .  etzel's character has been given more weight .  he is much more formidable .  all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem .  lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense ,  especially at the banquet scene ,  which is intercut with verbal's second performance to an amazing effect .  however ,  as is the nature of this half of the poem ,  the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one ,  for the most part ,  except for a dazzling sequence where etzel's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside .  the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending .  spoilers :  in the poem ,  after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther ,  they are imprisoned .  kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde .  he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother .  when hagen still refuses ,  she decapitates him .  hildebrand  ( or possibly dietrich )  is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he ,  in turn ,  decapitates her ,  calling her a  " devil woman "  .  etzel ,  who is much weaker in the poem than he is here ,  says something silly like :   " ah me !  "  i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle ;  to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic .  i also understand why they didn't have hildebrand kill kriemhild :  his character is much reduced here ;  his name is only mentioned once .  but ,  to have kriemhild kill herself ,  adopting brynhild's death from the icelandic sources ,  is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them .  the point of the poem is that kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil .  here ,  we simply have her die for her lost love .  it's not as interesting . 
0	some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential .  but it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school .   there are two primary reasons for this .  fist ,  there is not a single likable character ,  not even a villain we might admire for his/her chutzpah .  secondly ,  all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe .  the ham is so plentiful here ,  you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking .  then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up .   all right ,  i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said ,  the camera work is quite good .   but i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a  " modern western "  ,  and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making .   that betrayal is what hurts ;  but even without it ,  the fact remains that we don't like these characters ,  we feel embarrassed for the actors ,  the story is hopelessly muddled ,  and in the last analysis ,  we just don't care .   i took it out of the dvd player about half way through .  but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back .   now ,  that really hurts . 
0	man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds .  but with new worlds come ancient evils .  .  .  the vampires of space .  and not just a handful but entire tribes .  in this film  ( which i saw as  " bloodsuckers "  but i guess also goes as  " vampires wars "  )  we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires .   i will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review .  the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of b-list and upcoming stars .  natassia malthe was quintana ,  and was far more attractive here than in  " bloodrayne 2 "  .  michael ironside is muco ,  and is always a fan favorite  ( as i say ,  he's the poor man's jack nicholson )  .  and we even get carrie-ann fleming as  " damian's wife "  ,  who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous jenifer from dario argento's  " jenifer "  .  so this movie ,  as bad as it is ,  isn't without some names attached .  .  .  but the same can be said of uwe boll's work .   the concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea ,  but it easily falls into the realm of  " cheese "  and this film falls hard .  the acting ,  especially from the vampires ,  is over the top and i just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing .  worst of all ,  the vampire tribes have the names  " voorhess "  and  " leatherfaces "  .  i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans ,  but it wasn't clever at all .  it just sounded dumb and out of place  ( unlike the much more subtle references in james gunn's  " slither "  ,  such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors )  .   that's all i want to say .  if you can stand lots of cheese  ( on this day i couldn't and i'm from wisconsin )  and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space  ( although  " space "  looks a lot like any other forest on earth )  check this one out ,  if you can find it .  i don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films  ( jon carpenter's  " vampires "  )  or other cheesy space movies .  or maybe even some good ones .  but ,  hey ,  do your thing . 
0	i sat down to watch a documentary about puerto rico ,  and i ended up watching one about nuyoricans .  when i go to puerto rico ,  i fail to see the 50% that live in poverty .  when i do see struggling people ,  they are usually haitians ,  dominicans ,  or cubans that have recently arrived to the island .  there is no such thing as spanglish .  .  .  either you speak spanish ,  or you don't .  .  .  .  and from what i heard .  .  .  you don't .  pedro albizo campos is not mlk to me .  mlk was a great man .  campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1% .  to the rest he as loco as osama bin laden .  puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools .  if you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent puerto rico see cuba ,  haiti ,  dominican republic ,  bahamas ,  all of south and central america ,  and mexico .  its worked wonders for them .  this documentary is not about puerto rico ,  this documentary was about the nuyoricans and their struggles .   to the person that complaint that not enough of africa was on the show .  .  .  it was suppose to be about puerto rico .  .  .  not africa .  denzel will make one shortly just for you .   in conclusion .  .  .  to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the us ,  and want to learn how the prime minister runs things ,  this is not a good documentary about puertorican culture .  tell your kids to pay attention in geography ,  and history class .   ***update***  bocabonita .  .  .   " doc .  "  was about nuyoricans .  she promoted it as if its how we all feel .  should have been titled .  .  .   " yo soy nuyorican .  .  .  lunche .  .  . can't speak spanish .  "  please stop using puerto rico ,  rican ,  boricua ,  or anything else associated with pr with this nuyorican historical lesson .  god forbid they play this on the island . 
1	this is not my favorite wip  (  " women in prison "  )  ,  but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre .  it is was produced by roger corman ,  who at this point had already produced a few wips .  it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula .  the movie takes place in an usa prison ,  not in a  " banana republic "  like most wip films .  i'm not sure if that was a wise move ,  but it is an acceptable change of pace .  writer-director demme really gets into his job ,  always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario .  in fact ,  he is a little too ambitious for his own good .  the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick .  but do not worry ,  demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre .  there is plenty of nudity and violence ,  something that will satisfy hardcore fans .  the film is a little slow ,  but it is very entertaining .  the cast is good .  roberta collins is a wip veteran ,  so she does not need an introduction ,  and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden .  pam grier is sorely missed ,  though . 
1	sandler is amazing again .  .  .  i have already become a sandler fan .  this movie is the saddest sandler story .  its expression is fantastic .  i cried more watching click but there are some similar points .  to consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'i love you' are a few of the most impressive truths in life .  .  .  it is tough ,  it is real .  .  .  and actually there is a real owner of this success ,  binder .  i don't think another director could give these emotions in such a way .    cheadle and burrows are also amazing .  .  .  cheadle is one of my favorites since crash .  don't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere .  .  .  if you are ready to face the realities of life ,  don't miss this movie . 
1	this is an excellent movie .  it is about many things :  the hunt for a serial killer ,  the bureacracy of soviet russia ,  the drive of one man ,  and the relationship between this man  ( the lead detective )  and his superior .   the thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between durokov  ( rea )  and fetisov  ( sutherland )   ( excuse bad spelling ,  please !  )  .  for some reason ,  it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together .  one line in the movie sums it up for me :   " he would say something witty ,  but he is overcome with emotion .  "   excellent acting by all of the cast ,  even the smallest parts were done with believability .   this is not a fast-paced action thriller ;  in fact ,  it moves at times like a slow drama ,  but it is worth it .  very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all .   
0	i saw this movie ,  just now ,  not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in israel .  and to summarize everything right now ,  i will just say :  this is not a good film .   this is dror shaul's second feature film ,  and i have to admit that his first and the tv drama he made before this picture are much better .  further more ,  this is his first attempt at directing a drama .  the early works were comedies ,  and were funny and effective .   the first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film :  israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of israel .  the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire ,  and some of them disappear one by one .  the kibbutz ,  hebrew word for collective ,  was a sort of village for members only ,  where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life .  with the change in social values with time ,  it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed ,  locked within the dogma rules ,  with no ticket out .  the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive .  the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that .   but ,  i regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz .  once ,  it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment .  but the film shows the opposite .  that the kibbutz ,  with it's socialist dogma ,  was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people ,  with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective .  this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism :  your individuality is the most important thing .  you must place yourself in the center ,  and no one else but you is the matter .  this is the philosophy the film stands for ,  and that's just it's first sin .   if you disagree with me on the political side ,  i'm sure you will agree that the acting ,  the tone of the film ,  it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow .  the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember .  it is also very  " delicate "  ,  a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions ,  which do not surface ,  not in the film and not with the viewer .  it brings nothing but boredom .   can someone please explain :  why this film won so many prizes ?  maybe because it shows that israel is in line with the rest of the world ,  hating socialist and human values ?  or maybe it shows that israel is a  " delicate "  place ,  not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism ?  that we are basically very human and good people ,  capable of emotions ,  especially when they are fake ones ,  just like capitalism expects us to be ?  or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years ,  a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state ?  no matter what the answer is ,  it's not a good one .  not for the world ,  not for human values and not for the jews . 
0	universal's answer to  " the exorcist "  isn't a very good one .  unfortunately ,  the film offers bland ,  unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater-sized plot-holes .  not to mention ,  it's unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story .   model cristina raines moves into a high-rise owned by the catholic church with a creepy ,  blind priest john carradine ,  who holes up in there always at the window .  she begins to suffer faint spells and nausea .  what's worse is tenants she meets in the building such as burgess meredith ( with a cat and a canary !  ) and a young beverly d'angelo as a lesbian .  ava gardner ( looking great at 55 ) is the realtor who showed raines the place .  cristina's lover is chris sarandon ,  whose wife  " committed suicide "  after finding out they were having an affair .  josé ferrer has a small role as the  " priest of the brotherhood "  who informs monsignor arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high-rise not only housing carradine but raines as well .  sarandon sends a hired-hand up to the high-rise one night to check out a certain room above cristina's apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket .  he winds up dead the very same night cristina  " kills "  her dead father in a nightmare .  screaming mad on the street ,  cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli wallach and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hot-shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife's suicide .  that case is really a motivating factor is wallach's dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on cristina and if sarandon has anything to do with it .  you also have martin balsam as a professor who understands this type of latin cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room ( now renovated ) that cristina once stayed in !  what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation .  towards the end of the film wallach and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating .  their characters are just left on the back-burner .  how the priests know that  " now is the time "  when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high-rise and why cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn't adequately explained .  how certain ghosts just appear to cristina and disappear when she tries to show gardner the rooms they occupied during a cat's birthday ( see for yourself ) isn't adequately explained .  not to mention gardner's role in the grand scheme of things .  . she brings people to that high-rise ,  but what is really her reasons in the film ?  it seems like this film should've been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary . 
0	  ok ,  well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers ,  and let me say ,  it didn't help the film any .   the film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis ,  he loves the car more than anything around him ,  one day his wife decides to borrow the car .  since i don't want to spoil  ( not that there was anything to spoil )  i shall let your imagination figure out the  " zany "   ( and i use that word lightly )  antics that follow .   i had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film ,  and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous ,  please don't ,  it's a waste of the film it was printed on .   then again i could be wrong .  .  . 
0	this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucination .   boringly directed by william marsh in over-saturated hues ,  a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking .  and that's it .  except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures ,  be it political or pampered .  within the first reel you know exactly where this is going .   what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome ,  badly written bore ?  made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents !  avoid . 
1	wow ,  i can't believe i waited so long to see this film .  i just never got around to watching it .  the plot has nothing that interests me .  i know nothing about soccer  ( football .  )  i am one of those american fools that has no clue .  i had never even seen david beckham before this film .  i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america .  enough about me .    truth be told ,  it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven .  what a fun film .  it's full of color and exuberance .  i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie .  parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable ,  you can't help but root for her .  no wonder why the american television show e . r .  has snatched her up .  i have a new appreciation for indian culture .  those people know how to have a good time .  the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful .    the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents .  i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything .   ( this is not a criticism of the film !  )  i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well .    this is a perfect date film .  it has a great sports plot like rocky ,  and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women .  i watched it with my wife ,  and sixteen year old niece ,  and we all loved it .  i highly recommend it . 
1	in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town ,  partied pretty hardy .  after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa .    the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different .  but fleming was a man of all business ,  he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it .    with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part ,  we got to know all the drovers at some point .  a some point story lines were focused around all of them ,  though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates ,  the number 2 guy with the herd .   clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide ,  it's a shame that these are not shown more often .  probably because they were done in black and white .  had this been an nbc show ,  this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are .  we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend .   ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films .  he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name .  sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film ,  drowned in a river .  had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's .   clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run .  and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre .   rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it .  no frills in this one ,  these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year .   they really don't make television series like these any more .  what a pity . 
0	my complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand .  while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective ,  too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting  ( such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment ,  &tc .  ,  or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown )  .  also ,  the movie crawls along in covering c .  1920-1939 and then steams through the war years .  in sum ,  the film is little better than a history channel documentary ,  with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels' life .  still ,  i found it wanting . 
0	having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it .  well i don't know why i bothered .  basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure ,  hidden by the knights templar during the war of independence .  apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs .  firstly ,  why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america ?  how did nic cages character figure out that 'charlotte' was in fact a ship ?  how do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute ?  and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world ?  these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong .  cage has been in some great action movies - 'face-off' and 'the rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this ?  is he getting too old ?  !  his character is pretty annoying really - somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the declaration of independancd ,  outruns thieves with guns ,  escapes from the fbi and generally seems invincible .  the whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment . 
1	teenager eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music .  one day he finds out his hero sammi curr has died ,  supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music .  but eddie has his last record ,  never released ,  and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors .  before long sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked him .   filled with humour and in-jokes ,  this is a highly entertaining film .  sammi himself is an original horror movie villain ,  plays on the 'evils of rock music' obsessions of the 80's .  well worth watching . 
0	 .  .  . from this awful movie !  there are so many things wrong with this film ,  acting ,  writing ,  direction ,  editing ,  etc .  that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst .  the music !  i noted that the film has two composers listed .  this must be the reason why every single frame has music ,  of the absolute worst  " d "  movie style drivel .  they have never heard of the expression  " less is more "  .  it got so painful to listen to ,  i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue ,  not that the dialogue was that good .  you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley ,  i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers .  see it at your own risk . 
1	so ,  every year there is at least one movie ,  that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success ,  because from the moment of production ,  even before one simple shot is filmed ,  everybody's picking on this movie .  .  .  there is a long list of these kind of movies ,  and in the end ,  some are really bad  ( battlefield earth  ( 2000 )  )  ,  some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable  ( catwoman  ( 2004 )  ,  elektra  ( 2005 )  )  and then there are a few ,  which actually are really great for what they are ,  but no one admits !  i mean ,  my gosh ,  just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on ,  not everybody has to join them .  so yeaaah ,  maybe those movies aren't perfect ,  but c'mon ,  how many movies are ?  not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings !  not everybody will enjoy these movies ,  but i bet there are more than who admit they do .  hudson hawk  ( 1991 )  ,  who is just hysterical funny ,  color of night  ( 1994 )  ,  which may not be oscar-worthy ,  but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists ,  swept away  ( 2002 )  ,  which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance ,  gigli  ( 2003 )  ,  which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former  " bennifer " -couple ,  and this year it's  " basic instinct 2 "  !  well ,  when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically ,  and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie .  and really ,  i was very positively surprised !  i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here .  it never simply copies the original ,  it has a quite clever story ,  has tension ,  action ,  humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life !  with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s ,  but it's more than her being beautiful ,  it's brilliantly acted ,  with all her looks ,  her famous smile ,  the way she speaks and moves .  .  .  from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her .  it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell ,  and all of the other actors deliver solid performances ,  too !  so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie .  .  .  it has a dark ,  thrilling ,  sexy and gritty look ,  strong performances ,  and you never felt bored !  maybe the story isn't oscar-caliber ,  but it never even tries to be !  it's an entertainment-movie ,  and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion !  so give it a try ! 
0	i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one .  edward furlong ,  you're not as good as you think mate ,  you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap ,  which sole intention has to be to get some bucks .   the filming is bad ,  and i mean bad .  anyone with a camera would get the same result ,  or better .   the acting ,  lets just say :  don't go to the supermarket looking for actors .  the good ones usually come with a degree or ,  at least ,  have some damn experience !  the director .  .  mr .  jon keeyes ,  please find your purpose in life ,  as a director you simply suck .  your directing is poor ,  the angles are all messed up  ( not in a good way )  ,  the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper ,  and the damn music .  .  it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason .  and don't go for writer either ,  by the way .  making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop ,  it requires art and skill ,  things i really doubt you'll ever have .   instead of making a badass shootout movie ,  you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up .  .  or just go find a job on a coffeshop .  you'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night .   vote :  1/10  ( my first one ) 
1	although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special .   if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers .  i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film .  they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers .   i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten ,  which is where a good portion of this film dwells ,  because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing .  everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end .  from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting .  it doesn't kill the film ,  but it does weaken it .   still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale ,  or even a great movie . 
0	syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it .  i suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent .  .  . so intelligent that i think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind .  i don't consider myself unintelligent ,  i've been studying politics since my early teens and i enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message .  syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away .  i would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better .  this film was the most confusing ,  senseless ,  mindless dribble i have seen in awhile .  .  . especially considering the critical acclaim ,  the oscar nods ,  and the cast .  screenplay writer stephen gaghan has disappointed me yet again .  his horribly written havoc preceded this film and i think he's just trying way too hard .  i can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the da vinci code screenplay .  on top of that gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess .  i had no idea who anyone was ,  why things were happening ,  who was who and what was what .  it was a disaster .   because i don't really know who anyone was i can only mention the actors and what i thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright .  george clooney plays c . i . a .  field agent and assassin i think ?  ?  bob barnes .  clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part .  barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if i knew what was going on with him i would have really enjoyed his character .  matt damon plays bryan woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which i can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it .  amanda peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given .  christopher plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something .  i like plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore .   the cast is intense if only the story made sense .  i'd like to exact quote the description of plot on imdb .   " a missile disappears in iran ,  but the cia has other problems :  the heir to an emirate gives an oil contract to china ,  cutting out a us company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a kazakhstani oil contract .  the department of justice suspects bribery ,  and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat .  the cia also needs one when its plot to kill the emir-apparent fails .  agent bob barnes ,  the fall guy ,  sorts out the double cross .  an american economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the cia wants dead .  the jobless pakistanis join a fundamentalist group .  all roads start and end in the oil fields .  "  what !  ?  !  ?  say who now ?  ?  syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard i tried to stay with it i eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it .  i suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but i promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour .  1/10
0	time is precious .  this film isn't .  i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time .   the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction :  is this the film the critics are raving about ?  what a piece of crap !   the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family .  get it ?   the acting is superb .   the production  ( lighting ,  sets ,  editing ,  sound )  is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story .  the characters are shallow and unintelligent .  i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience ;  the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next .   i have had more fun doing the laundry . 
1	the 40 year-old virgin  ( 2005 )  **** steve carell ,  catherine keener ,  paul rudd ,  romany malco ,  seth rogen ,  elizabeth banks ,  leslie mann ,  jane lynch ,  gerry bednob ,  shelley malil ,  kat dennings .  hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer  ( wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a-list )  ,  a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies  ( rudd ,  malco & rogen ,  each one degree funnier than the next )  determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost .  what follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother  ( the marvelous keener having lots of fun here )  leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy .  a surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy ;  the funniest since  " there's something about mary "  with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke ,  homophobic debunking ribbing ,  send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb .  a true winner and an instant classic ;  the funniest film of the year . 
0	that's not the sound of bees ,  that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long ,  extremely boring ,  badly acted movie .  how i ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep i'll never know .  the plot is simple .  .  . 3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours .  and you thought rohmer was deadly .  this is even worse ,  if that's possible .  > i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off .  .  . or killing someone . 
0	this movie was terrible .  at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok ,  so i watched it .  the acting was terrible .  it was like the actor were almost camera shy .  everything seemed fake .  i feel bad for edward furlong ,  terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .  .  i've watched it at least 20 times .  .  .  .   the plot was also crap .  the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines .   on the plus side ,  it's the good kind of bad movie .  the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get ,  so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was .   i think everybody should watch this ,  so that then we could appreciate better other ,  real ,  movies . 
0	it seems to me ,  as a recent film school graduate ,  that in these times of new zealand film reaching new heights ,  the general public seems to think every new zealand film made is great .  sione's wedding proves this is dead wrong .   it's completely overrated and not funny ,  and far from the 'hilarious' film other users of imdb have commented .  the only really funny thing i found in this film was derek the wannabe black guy ,  but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we'd all heard before .   being of half-samoan decent ,  i wanted to see how the film was going to deal with polynesian representation .  it was a complete balls-up - i know it's a supposed comedy ,  but i didn't feel like the characters had anything new to say about polynesian identity ,  even if it was in a tongue-in-cheek manner .  i was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships - mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women ,  comes to slightly turn his ways when the 'dusky maiden' comes to town ,  has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship ,  then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a polynesian playboy for palagi women .  i didn't understand why they did this .   all in all ,  it was very disappointing .  my whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh ,  but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema .  the jokes are lame at best ,  the acting ,  particularly of sefa's girlfriend ,  appalling ,  and honestly i would've been happy if i had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the $15 ticket price .   i think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it's the second step  ( behind no .  2 ,  of course ,  a far superior film to this one )  in the birth of polynesian cinema .  i hope pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from sione's wedding in how to not reflect polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say .  even if it is done in a comedic fashion . 
0	the brain that wouldn't die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits .  it's got all the classic signs of being bad :  unbelieveable plotline ,  terrible acting ,  low-grade sets and lighting .  the plotline goes like this :  when a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident ,  she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab ,  where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive .  i'll bet virgnina leath ,  who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table .  anyway ,  the doctor then tries to find her a new body ,  and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body .  bad all the way through ,  so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000 . 
1	this is just a great ,  fun ,  lovely film .  it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people ,  and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors .  though this film may only be in black and white ,  it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days .  the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless .  this movie features great acting ,  beautiful song and dance numbers ,  and great design work and film shots .  follow the fleet is also comical ,  there are funny moments ,  moments that will make you laugh ,  but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline .  its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade ,  how it can affect those today .  if you want to see something great ,  check this out . 
0	this movie was exactly what i expected ,  not great ,  but also not that bad either .  in my opinion pg13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film .  sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room ,  but nothing we all haven't already seen .  i guess i didn't like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening ;  it got old and repetitive .  i also didn't understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not .  there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred .  the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about .  what i did like was the special effects .  other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it .  maybe its just me but i thought this was below average . 
1	unlike some comments ,  mine is positive .  this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends ,  some you like ,  some you don't .  a few are related--mother ,  daughter ,  son .  their stories are not one smooth ,  happy with everyone and everything ,  type of life--much like real life .  some story lines do not evolve ,  they just happen .  but like true families and good friends ,  they stick together .  the wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes !  you are happy for the ending .  poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself ,  her mom ,  her son ,  and trying to keep all their lives together .  this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world ,  but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day ,  month to month .  overall ,  this is a good story and a great movie !  ! 
1	the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved .  i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made .  i love all six of the stooges  ( curly ,  shemp ,  moe ,  larry ,  joe ,  and curly joe )  !  all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts !  in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team !    one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than husbands beware !  all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine mcintyre ,  dee green ,  doris houck ,  alyn lockwood ,  johnny kascier ,  nancy saunders ,  lu leonard ,  maxine gates ,  and emil sitka .  green and mcintyre provide great performances here !  there are so many funny parts here .  this is a very hilarious short .  there is another similar three stooges short like this one called brideless groom and i recommend both ! 
1	a powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany ,  two  " colored "  sisters who lived past the age of 100 .  wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll ,  respectively ,  they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth  ( played by amy madigan )  ,  a white new york times reporter .  the flashback and present-day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book ,  but really are powerful .  however ,  certain aspects of the sisters' lives ,  such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father's stern personality are not presented clearly .  you need to read the book to fully understand these things .  which is just as well ,  because the book's just as great !  aside from those flaws ,  it's wonderfully done and performed ,  especially by dee and carroll ,  and a very powerful and educational movie . 
1	this man is nothing short of amazing .  you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events ,  and cry along with his family in the end .  he was so passionate about his cause ,  not just for himself ,  but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain .  i watch this video every time i am having a bad or  " down "  day ,  and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life ,  just like jonny did ,  even with his unbearable pain .  my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner ,  as i visited england 2 times during his life ,  and would have been able to say i'd met him .  it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud ,  pain free !  rest in peace ,  dear jonny .  you deserve it ! 
0	i'm not sure quite why i clicked  " contains spoiler "  ,  because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it .   visually it mostly delivers .  well ,  apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters .  i'll say now that before watching this i had never seen the band lordi ,  nor knew anything about them bar that they won eurovision .  apparently the monsters in this are members of the band ,  pretty much in their stage personas .  whatever .  anyway ,  i didn't know this while watching .  i just thought the monsters/demons were mostly passable .  just about .   i'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on-screen ,  but it may actually be better not to know it .  it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it .  the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained ,  even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly .   i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it ,  especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing .  must have been the mood i was in ,  but i found that hella funny for some reason .  then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to be about .  that amused me further ,  and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10 .   it's not scary ,  or particularly coherent ,  but it's pretty nice visually and sonically .  overall ,  far from essential ,  but watchable .  don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood . 
1	this is the best and most original show seen in years .  the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it .  the cast is excellent ,  the writing is great .  i personally like every character .  however ,  there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life .  i believe abc has done a disservice to the writers ,  actors and to the potential audience of this show ,  to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following .  there are so few shows i watch anymore as most tv is awful  .  this show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites greys anatomy and brothers and sisters .  in fact i think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they even knew about it .  why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away .  i am so sick of reality shows i do not watch any of them .  it was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors ,  this show had so much promise .  the recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real .  please watch this show on abc's video and let abc know you wish to have this show back .  please sign the online petition to abc :  http : //www . petitiononline . com/gh1215/petition . html
1	the farrelly brothers ,  bobby and peter ,  are at it again .  with  " fever pitch "  the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes ,  abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen ,  something that it would have been hard to do .  the novel ,  of the same title ,  dealt with a man's obsession with soccer ,  since it is set in england ,  where that sport consumes most of british sports fans .  it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell ,  to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans ,  when they make their hero ,  a boston red sox fan .    " fever pitch "  is a film that presents an obsessive fan ,  ben wrightly ,  whose life revolves into the red sox season ,  and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them .  when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm ,  he meets ,  and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks ,  a young woman who is going places ,  but at thirty ,  has no life of her own .   the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox ,  at home games ,  in fenway park .  this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world ,  having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but ,  until 2004 ,  never won a world series .  in fact ,  the ending ,  from what we heard ,  had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years !  drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film .  ms .  barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera .  jimmy fallon ,  a popular television comedian ,  turned movie actor ,  has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in  " taxi "  ,  in our humble opinion .   the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale . 
1	the only thing serious about this movie is the humor .  well worth the rental price .  i'll bet you watch it twice .  it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role . 
1	i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's - i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video  ( finally it's out )  .  it was made in brazil ,  so i assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet .  i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out !  it is one of my all-time favorites - but be warned ,  it is weird ,  like werner herzog weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism .   the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago ,  in pre-colonial times ,  when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon .  a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy ,  so they intend to kill him .  before they dispatch him ,  though ,  they make him part of their tribe  ( their custom )  .  the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe .  that's it .  cosmic plotline ?  no .  intense insight into the variety of human life ?  definitely .   oh yeah .  .  .  be warned .  .  .  this film has definite nudity - this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages .  .  .  this film tells it like it was  ( re-read above :  national geographic ,  super-realism )   
0	i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood-not very big-names in it .  interested enough i decide to give it a shot later .  .  it was a tough to bear experience believe me .  then ,  after finally seeing the credits roll i tought 'we turks really suck at hollywood style film making .  .  this is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre .  . ' but then wait !  i checked some names and no ,  they were not turkish names and no ,  this was not a turkish movie ;  on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director & crew !  that made me thinking-again ! - how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen ,  edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project ?  with money probably .  .  that kept me thinking further .  .  how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast ?  then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer . by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find .  and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then :  by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa i don't have any information on that- .  so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as .  .  it makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect .  .  this one at least makes you think ;  it makes you wonder .  .  it leaves you with disbelief .  .  and then it makes you wonder again .  . 
1	an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman .  one of the cop  ( périer )  killed her ,  but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other  ( montand )  .  the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her ,  and périer doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl .  montand must absolutely find the killer .  .  . and what a great ending !  highly recommended . 
1	director edward sedgwick ,  an old hand at visual comedy ,  successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast-moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting ,  employing a large number of roach's reliable performers .  although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly ,  sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins ,  a young kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood ,  where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves ,  star-struck cecilia  ( rosina lawrence )  .  sedgwick ,  who prefers using the entire m-g-m studio as his set ,  does so here as cecilia ,  always ready for an audition ,  is treated by a would-be paramour ,  cinema star rinaldo lopez  ( mischa auer )  ,  to behind-the-scenes action of ,  naturally ,  a musical comedy ,  featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti .  laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes ,  including their well-known skit involving a tiny harmonica ,  and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton ,  russell hicks and walter long .  on balance ,  one must hand the bays to mischa auer ,  who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star ,  a role which he largely creates ,  and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley's filmic spectacles . 
1	this is the best emma in existence in my opinion .  having seen the other version  ( 1996 )  which is also good ,  and read the book ,  i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece .  the 1996 movie with g .  paltrow is good too ,  it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether .  it's very light and fluffy ,  you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie ,  that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points ,  such as the churchill/fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent .  but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit ,  more real and multidimensional ,  the 1996 tv version is the superior .  emma is a remarkable person ,  but she is flawed .  kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character .  you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith ,  yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending .  you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims .  for emma ,  it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage .  for frank churchill ,  it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret .  in the book ,  she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made .  both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like ,  selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult .  both versions are very good but i prefer this one . 
1	i saw the movie with two grown children .  although it was not as clever as shrek ,  i thought it was rather good .  in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break ,  there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it .  there parents also seemed engaged .  the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments .  hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids .  as such ,  it was successful although i liked it too .  personally i liked the scrat !  ! 
1	this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time ,  i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title .  loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and edison's portrayal of a killer machine ,  which totally reversed his normal idol image .  i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie .  however ,  i must warn you ,  this is also an equally depressing movie ,  as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own ,  and struggling to breathe .  makes you think about what is life about really . 
0	man ,  what a scam this turned out to be !  not because it wasn't any good  ( as i wasn't really expecting anything from it )  but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its  " stars "  as being stuart whitman ,  stella stevens and tony bill .  sure enough ,  their names did not appear in the film's opening credits ,  much less themselves in the rest of it !  !  as it turned out ,  the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady  ( 1975 )   but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody's guess   even so ,  since i paid $1 . 50 for its rental and i was in a monster-movie mood anyhow ,  i elected to watch the movie regardless and ,  yup ,  it stunk !  apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew ,  an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws-like pretensions and ,  intentionally so ,  at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on .  the creature itself  a plesiosaur i . e .  half-dinosaur/half-fish  is imperfectly realized  ( naturally )  but ,  as had been the case with the giant claw  ( 1957 )  which i've also just seen ,  this didn't seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can ,  especially during the movie's second half ! 
1	i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie ,  because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines .  the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written ,  but along the way ,  they run into the usual problems ,  including kermit's memory loss here .  while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original  " muppets movie ,  "  there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman .  simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great ,  and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious .  the original songs are also good here ,  and the ending is satisfying .  there is not much else to say about the film ,  but muppet fans should see it for sure .  it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all .   ***1/2 out of ****
0	this movie was a rather odd viewing experience .  the movie is obviously based on a play .  now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch .  the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie .  instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play ,  with over-the-top characters and staged dialog .  because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience .   it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching .  at first you think its a drama you're watching ,  with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy ,  that leans really more toward the comedy genre ,  rather than the drama genre .   the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable .  sure ,  the actors are great ;  peter o'toole and susannah york ,  amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough' .   the story feels totally disorientated .  basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york .  but what exactly is the story even about ?  the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer .  like i said before ;  i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out .   the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences .    more was to expect from director j .  lee thompson ,  who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed ,  stage-play translated to screen ,  project .   really not worth your time .   4/10
1	this slick and gritty film consistently delivers .  it's one of frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date  ( and if you are scratching your head thinking  " but i loved get shorty "  you need to be punched in the face )  .  in my opinion ,  no one captures the  " feel "  for leonard's characters better then john glover in 52 pick-up .  the relocation of the story from detroit  ( novel )  to hollywood  ( film )  elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights .  be a man ,  have a few beers and watch this movie .  for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are :  swag ,  rum punch ,  cat chaser ,  city primeval ,  and 52 pick-up .  my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate .  i also have a real special place in my cold ,  movie heart for dead bang and black sunday . 
0	i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity .  my intention is not to burst anyone's bubble ,  because i've seen ,  as i've skimmed through other comments ,  that this movie is quite appreciated by many .  well ,  it is not worth any praises ,  and i say this because i've seen the original anime ,  basilisk ,  and this movie shames it deeply .  perhaps if you see shinobi alone ,  you could like it .  it is enjoyable due to the well-choreographed battles ,  based on fantasy more than on martial arts ,  and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced .  but the story is nothing like the original one .  now ,  i understand that when one transforms an anime/manga into a movie ,  one must make certain changes .  i was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime ,  although they have a well-established role ,  and some are truly profound and well-designed .  but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly-placed changes ,  that basically ruin the entire story .  characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated ,  transformed in something the public might love more ,  perhaps .  for instance ,  oboro ,  who ,  in the anime is a sweet ,  innocent girl ,  completely and utterly in love with gennosuke ,  becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie .  i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era  ( we are talking about japan ,  17th century )  ,  but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written .  hotarubi ,  which is one of my favourite characters in the film ,  but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature ,  becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime ,  but is more or less worthless in the plot .  i could go on and on ,  like how they made tenzen ,  the worst and most dangerous character in the anime ,  exceptionally weak and unattractive ,  or how gennosuke ,  the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused ,  not to mention ,  again weak .  the music is beautiful and the image is astounding ,  which was expected of a japanese movie ,  and i appreciate it for that .  but do not watch this if you've seen and enjoyed basilisk ,  because it is just hopeless .  basilisk ,  although based on fantasy ,  with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters ,  storyline ,  historical value and it is ,  may i say ,  heartbreaking .  shinobi was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax .  alas ,  it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly ,  but i advise you against it .  please ,  watch the anime ,  or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what basilisk really is by watching the anime .  otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they've massacred it . 
1	i just got this video used and i was watching it last night .  the acting started out extremely bad  ( hey------hey------twister )  but got very good soon after wards .  the tornadoes looked extremely fake ,  and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy ,  but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done ,  and just about on par with movies like twister .  the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too .  the story was very well written ,  and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old  " disaster formulas "  movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years .   while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality ,  this merits an a in my book . 
0	this movie is just so awful .  so bad that i can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words .  avoid this movie at all costs ,  it is terrible .   none of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly .  lots of slaughterhouse footage .  weird cuts and edits .  no continuity to the plot .  the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seen .   this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content .  the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky .  it looks as if it was shot on video .   in fact ,  now that they've got dennis rader with life in prison ,  i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well .   seriously ,  don't even think about watching this one .  i'd give it a negative star if i could . 
0	quite average even by monogram standards ,  this mystery  ( a remake of the sphinx )  has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect -- you'll see through it after about ten minutes .  the two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset ,  but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain  ( perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role )  and warren hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying .  however ,  it's worth sitting through for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable mantan moreland as nicodemus the janitor ,  who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance .  you've got to hand it to bill  " one-take "  beaudine ;  he wasn't much of a director ,  but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville . 
1	firstly ,  this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen .  it incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick ,  sexual humour ,  and cleverly-thought-up stand-up .  but it goes deeper than that .  the souler opposite is an original love story  ( something we don't see that often )  that gave me hope that there is love out there ; that two people who love each other can work through their adversity ;  and that such a comedic take on life  ( something i believe we all should have )  can be accepted by the people that really matter .  chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar .  the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future . 
0	i've always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past ,  but only a blind lover could ignore how dull ,  meaningless ,  pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is .  a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds .  and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed  " actor allen-clone "  ,  that is putting into will farrell's mouth and gestures what allen would have done in farrell's place had he been 30 years younger .  the outcome was obviously ludicrous .  and not to speak of the dialogues .  .  .  what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering ,  unaware of its comic effect .  how sad .  .  . 
0	i think this would have been a much better film if the cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light .  my family is from the southeast region of louisiana and i live in southeast texas  ( about 20 miles from lake charles )  .  i have never heard the people i grew up around talk like these folks did .  the cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks .  most of the cajuns i know are well educated ,  proud people and don't sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did .  all in all it was an ok movie ,  with great scenery and music .  i understand that the writers were from lake charles ,  and have knowledge of the area ,  but for the love of all things cajun ,  please have the actors study the language ,  live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them .  in my opinion ,  when the actors make you believe they are that person ,  it's a much more enjoyable movie ! 
0	i picked this up at the video store because of tarantino's recommendation  (  " if you don't like  ( this )  ,  go f&^% yourself !  "  )  on the box .  .  .  seemed like a ringing endorsement .  .  .  .  i was expecting something a bit more like  " death proof "  .  .  .  not much actual violence in this one tho ,  or plot ,  of character ,  or dialogue .    look at the poster .  it's all there .  stunts ,  and rock .  it goes back and forth .  a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show ,  at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip ,  and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet .  .  .  they work ,  they meet girls ,  they party .  end of story .   the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second-tier ,  and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 .  it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that aussie fellow really is something ,  and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the  " art "  .  i hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next .  just wish he could have found a better vehicle . 
1	for real film people ,  this film is a must ,  since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves .  janos rukh/boris karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena .  this light can do harm ,  or it can be harnessed to do good .  on the one hand it blinds his mother ,  on the other it is used to cure blindness  (  " i can see !  "  shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected )  .  when rukh/karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light ,  we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative ,  drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection ,  an entity viewed on film  ( only visible ,  as in a movie theater ,  when the lights are out )  .   there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff/rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years ,  as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock .    there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles :  that of the writer ,  in the persona of beulah bondi/arabella stevens ;  and religion ,  emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun .    one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time ,  and particularly at riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm : triumph of the will .    happily in the end ,  mother  ( violet kemble cooper )  intervenes ,  reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science .    if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout :   " i can see !  " 
0	i could not believe how awful this film was ;  i rarely watch commercial tv ,  but thought  " well ,  diane keaton is always worth watching "  .  i stand corrected .  everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame .   i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age ,  but the script to this was so inept ,  clichéd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms .  keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear .  none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable .  the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class - i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering  " what were they thinking ?  "  .  very ,  very sad that it has come to this .  don't waste your time . 
0	darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie  ( samaire armstrong )  who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary  ( tippi hedren )  is killed by a werewolf ,  you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley  ( ryan olosio )  who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself & that a so-called 'dark prince' werewolf  ( kane hodder )  wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world ,  or something like that .  understandably josie has a hard time believing it ,  that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes .  it's up to werewolf cop steve to save josie ,  the day & the world .  .  .   co-executive produced & directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me .  the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid .  for a start it's slow going ,  it's dull ,  it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't ,  i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead .  the script is dumb & doesn't explain itself ,  why has josie never turned into a werewolf before ?  is she really the only one ?  why can't this 'dark prince' find another female werewolf ?  there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half-way through but you get the idea anyway ,  as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least .   director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle .  now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special ,  the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi & it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen ,  seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics .  it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen ,  an american werewolf in london  ( 1981 )  was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light-years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf ,  who says special effects have improved over the years ?  the animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen .  the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else .  thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it ,  is it really worth it ?   technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever ,  it's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values .  the acting is what you'd expect really .   darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations ,  i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they're both horrible still .  .  . 
1	perspective is a good thing .  since the release of  " star wars episode i :  the phantom menace "  ,  claims and counter-claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films ,  making them part of a cohesive whole ,  rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies .  what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films .  this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy :   " return of the jedi "  .  often derided for its overly 'cute' factor ,  rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect  " the empire strikes back "  .  indeed the 'cute' element of rotj ,  namely the ewoks ,  remains a weak link in the entire series .  did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities ?  only he can answer that question .   this cute factor aside ,  the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga .  following on from the conclusion of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  luke skywalker  ( mark hamill )  follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine ,  his home planet ,  to rescue han solo  ( harrison ford )  ,  the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts .   skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi  ( alec guiness )  to fight the evil empire .  now swathed all in black ,  luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn .  his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest .  while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends ,  he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again ,  despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side .   early scenes in tatooine are impressive ,  from jabba's lair ,  to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand .  lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac ,  making it look fake and overdone .   the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding ,  and is one of the more memorable of the saga .  luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies ,  proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete .   when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time ,  the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime .  undoubtably the star of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen .   rotj really is luke's film ,  perhaps even more so than the original .  his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate .  the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow .  the romance between leia  ( carrie fisher )  and solo is all but non-existant ,  unlike in  " empire "  .  in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj ,  solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films .   their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion .  this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction .  the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all ,  while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside  ( or is that replace ?  )  darth vader .  the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film ,  less cunning than governor tarkin  ( peter cushing )  from  " star wars "  ,  more deeply psychologically dark than anything else .  played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid ,  the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate .   all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles .  hamill surprises as the more wisened luke ,  making his character's progression from whiny teenager ,  impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series .  ford's role is waring thin ,  as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the real star of the first film after all .  fisher's leia is more of a prop ,  at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about .  .  .  add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi ,  yoda and the loveable chewbacca ,  c-3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast .   despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire ,  it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence :  on endor ,  in space and on the death star ,  each with very impressive special effects .  the music ,  as always ,  is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance .  just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for  " 2001 :  a space odyssey "  ,  john williams' score is as much a part of  " star wars "  folklore as light sabers and the force .   lucas left the ending open to interpretation ,  meaning there could have been more episodes made .  indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii ,  viii and ix in their heads over and over again .  rotj works when given a chance ,  and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series .   when all six episodes get to be viewed together ,  this saga could well be the best ever made .  is it already ?  the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series .  this is why  " return of the jedi "  can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release . 
0	if you like films that are totally bizarre ,  then this one is for you !  abdullah is one mean mother ,  with a passion for strangling people and eating ham .  you should check this film out ,  just for a laugh .  it is a low budget sci-fi ,  musical ,  comedy ,  cannibalistic ,  classic .  if you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere ,  just for the sake of seeing the aliens ,  which are nothing more than little toy robots ,  but in my opinion are the films highlight .   " i'm the big meat eater ,  pass me
0	when i began watching the muppets take manhattan ,  the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced i was watching something recent ,  so you can imagine my surprise when i came to the imdb and read that it was made in 1984 .  jim henson may have ended the muppet show when it was at its peak ,  but spin offs like this and muppet babies  ( which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film )  are the absolute nadir of all things muppet .  i used to wonder why muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as mr .  cranky ,  so i am glad that the muppets take manhattan  ( henceforth :  tmtm )  set me straight on that one .  of course ,  many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around :  aliens ,  robocop ,  the evil dead ,  even night of the living dead .  so while it is no surprise that tmtm is less than the muppet movie or the great muppet caper ,  the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up tmtm is .  not only is the music far less satisfying ,  the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible .   there are ,  of course ,  some redeeming and genuinely funny moments ,  but they are few and far between .  the swedish chef is great in any scene he inhabits ,  so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest .  the problem is that there are just no scenes that work .  the story ,  such as it is ,  revolves around a broadway musical kermit is attempting to get produced .  he goes through many trials and tribulations along the way ,  including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before .  the biggest problem is that kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time .  charles durning was cinematic gold as doc hopper ,  the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit kermit for his business .  charles grodin was dynamite as nicky holiday ,  a jewel thief the muppets must fight in order to save miss piggy from a lifetime in prison .  the saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist ,  and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films .   charles grodin also highlights what is wrong with tmtm .  namely ,  the music sucks .  the opening number of the manhattan melodies show that is at the centre of tmtm ,  to put it nicely ,  makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated .  i might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me ,  but songs like the rainbow connection inspired tears of joy ,  not irritation .  grodin's big solo during the great muppet caper ,  while not having the same resonation ,  he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own .  he is all class .  and if there is one thing tmtm could use ,  it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class .  tmtm also feels severely time-compressed ,  with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion .  maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces .  see if you can find them in tmtm .   while tmtm does have its guest stars ,  they are either poorly utilised  ( brooke shields and john landis )  ,  or totally out of their element  ( liza minelli ,  dabney coleman )  .  to call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery .  the absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here ,  after animal's  " go home "  postscript for the muppet movie in particular .  which highlights another problem .  the characters are poorly written at best ,  with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard .  animal shouts singular words at times ,  but they have nothing to do with the plot ,  or the conversation going on around him .  say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters ,  but think of animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills ,  or his  " sowwy "  after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow muppets .  now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual muppet other than swedish chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn .  give up ?  then you have proved my point .   given that labyrinth ,  one of the henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the muppets ,  arrived some two years later ,  it makes tmtm all the more puzzling .  perhaps this misfire convinced jim henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage .  or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to frank oz ,  who at the time had just finished working with george lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original star wars saga .  the writers were also involved with the great muppet caper ,  so i will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film .  the production is also substantially improved here ,  with muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them .  had the story and script been better thought-out ,  tmtm might have been at least comparable to the great muppet caper .  as it stands now ,  it is a great answer to the question of whether muppets write under the influence ,  or excrete .   for that reason ,  i gave the muppets take manhattan a three out of ten .  two to denote its actual quality ,  and a bonus for the swedish chef's moments .  without him ,  this film would be unwatchable . 
1	shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time .  the language somehow breaks the time barrier .  but perhaps it is the actors who really do that .   after the disappointment in romeo and juliet  ( the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio )  ,  was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare .  to my surprise othello was great !   iago's character was played so well by the kenneth fellow !  even thoough iago is really evil and despicable ,  the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be ,  a pleasure for the audience to hate .  i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well .   i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students  ( who refuse to read the book )  alike . 
0	the dvd version consists of 2 episodes ,  the parricide of caesar being the juncture .  in addition ,  the language was spanish without subtitles .  hence ,  it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said .   cleopatra being an historic icon ,  the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer ,  leonor varela just plays fine .  she is strong-willed but also a very supportive ,  tender soul mate .  thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode .  so ,  it is not really a documentary ,  nor a peplum but a great love story .   after the parricide ,  a new lover comes  ( marc-antoine )  but the flavor is gone :  we remember always our first love .  so ,  i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully .   nonetheless ,  the production is luxurious :  the sets are big ,  tastefully decorated ;  the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid .  the producers have a lot of money for sure ,  but they spend nothing on the special effects .  they are so poor  ( blue screens ,  ships ,  sphinx )  that it's funny .   finally ,  i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies . 
0	i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television .  i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants .  what i didn't remember was how awful it was !  !  !   i recently caught this movie on television late at night .  i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again !  suzanne somers  ( at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company' )  plays a vacationer at lakewood manor .  constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest .  or should i say ,  a *man-eating ants' nest* !  !  one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants .  one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one ,  the next minute he's covered in them .  the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt .   if you thought that was pretty far-fetched ,  you should see myrna loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter !  i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie !   the final scenes depict suzanne ,  robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other ,  blowing through straws and covered in ants .   that's basically the movie .  there's really no  " disaster "  appeal or  " big-star "  draw to the film .  it was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time .  now ,  it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4 : 00am timeslot on your local television station .   if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best ,  then watch an episode of three's company .  if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills ,  then watch this movie .   0/10
1	whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year .  she is hilarious .  of course there was a major serious side to the show .  she was great not only because she's funny ,  but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum .  white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards' ceremonies ,  employment ,  and representation are way out of balance racially .  there should be no need for  " black "  awards shows .  the white-bread ,  milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to  " white "  directors ,  producers ,  actors ,  etc .  allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste .  he had no business being there .  the fact of the matter is ,  this is the first oscar presentation i've watched since  " the color purple "  was up for awards .  that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002 .  which is not to denigrate other presenters .  billy crystal is a riot . 
1	i first discovered alexander korda's  ( 1940 )  fantasy ,  the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as  " the wonder show of the century !  "  both korda technicolor films ,  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program .  the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films .  the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful !  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made .  as the years passed ,  it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in .  true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950's .  both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video .  but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor .  the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice ,  but not as it should be .  now comes the m-g-m dvd  ( 3 dec 2002 )  issue .  the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning !  !  !  it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once ,  i watched it a second time .  the only  " extras "  are a spanish dubbed version ,  sub-titles in both english & spanish ,  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer .  thank you m-g-m for this exceptional dvd release .  now ,  one can only hope that korda's four feathers and a restored version of korda's jungle book  ( to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation )  will soon follow on dvd . 
1	you can do a lot with a little cash .  blair witch proved that .  this film supports it .  it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity .  however ,  because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring .  the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere ,  bumbling watson ,  his dimness and slowness foils cleese's quick-tempered wit .  if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two . 
1	this is a film which had eluded me thus far but ,  now that i've watched it ,  emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style .  as usual with the divx format ,  the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and  ( mostly )  audio glitches  but ,  given that the film is still unavailable on r1 dvd ,  this will have to do for the moment .  since the film's reputation is quite high within the genre itself ,  i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well-known actor in the lead .   anyway ,  the belated entrance of the film's nominal star  franchot tone  packs quite a wallop  ( especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first )  !  tone was a underrated actor  he was rarely given meaty roles ,  and this may well be his best  ( making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous )  .  the female lead  ella raines ,  who would later feature in brute force  ( 1947 )  as well as siodmak's own the suspect  ( 1944 )  and the strange affair of uncle harry  ( 1945 )   is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss  ( alan baxter )  innocent of his wife's brutal murder .  other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator ,  and elisha cook jr .   the genre's quintessential fall guy  as an ill-fated  " ladies' man "  of a percussionist .   like brute force's jules dassin ,  siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction  all tilted angles and terrific set-pieces ,  including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly-attired raines  ( who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail )  .  another great ,  lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender  ( another uncooperative witness )  around the streets of new york  which results in his being mowed down by a car !    notable ,  too ,  is the trial sequence  which is entirely depicted through the audience's reaction so that judge ,  jury ,  witnesses and d . a .  are never actually seen  ( although the judge's voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s .  hinds )  .  the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved ,  with the inspector's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone  " dizzy spells "  .  the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment ,  where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with baxter's wife ,  but killed her when she wouldn't desert her husband for him .   by the way ,  i hit upon a little goof in the film :  while the story is clearly set in 1943 ,  i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film  in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater  the establishing shot of new york  ( comprising clearly of stock footage )  features a marquee promoting laurel and hardy's 1938 musical comedy ,  swiss miss !  incidentally ,  famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym . 
1	it's true that danny steinmann's  " the unseen "  is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot ,  no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades ,  but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film .  on the contrary ,  my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting .  the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival ,  but their hotel forgot to register their booking .  in their search for a place to stay ,  the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion .  one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house .   " the unseen "  can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics  " psycho "  and  " the texas chainsaw massacre "  .  the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films ,  like twisted family secrets in the cellar ,  voyeurism ,  crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens .  still ,  i don't consider these to be negative remarks ,  as  " the unseen "  is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade .  although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast ,  director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house  " unseen "  like the title promised .  the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre .  sydney lassick ,  immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in  " one flew over the cuckoo's nest "  is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller .  his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed .  also stephen furst ,  who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen ,  gives away a tremendous performance as  " junior "  .  he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving .   " the unseen "  is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff . 
1	the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time .  stunningly shot ,  with lighting effects that are truly sublime ,  this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d . w .  griffith and maurice tourneur .  how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know ,  but this film still has extraordinary power .  the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york ,  is very moving .  the themes of social injustice ,  revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today .  the use of close-ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying .  what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema . 
0	this was a truly bad film .  the character  " cole "  played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped ,  the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil ,  it didn't .  after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance ,  this would have added some sincerity .   - 1 )  badly acted - 2 )  unsympathetic characters - 3 )  razor thin plot line  yuck !   
0	arg .  the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film .  this time ,  european terrorists ( irish i'd say )  hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium .  they pull into a shipyard ,  open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs .  pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists ,  the cops and some marines .  the whole film seems to be  ( again )  largely inspired from alien ( as carnosaur 2 was )  with the pathetic marines going through the  " claustrophobic "  shipyard ?  guns at the ready .  this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot ,  with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off .  the dinos are stiff ,  shuffling creatures as usual and the t-rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars ( it also appears to have no eyes )  .  one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene :  they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck .  on opening it ,  surprise !  the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them .  why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first ?  how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside ?  what was the point of filming this scene ?  ?  ?  ?  oh bother ,  who cares ?  both thumbs down for the over-sized rubber iguanas . 
0	i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end .  i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldn't watch it was because of the 'actors' .  firstly ,  for the most part they just looked stiff and i'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but that's a minor issue .  the main issue i have with the actors isn't really their fault .  .  .  it's whoever cast this film !  come on ,  this movie came out in 2003 .  .  .  i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave ?  !  i cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines ,  from a grown man older than myself ,  is  " i'm 17 !  "  how can anyone take that seriously ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  don't fall victim to this movie ,  go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you'll get far more than this movie could ever give . 
1	time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds .  they're fun to consider in a 'what if ? ' sort of way .  film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek :  first contact' ,  the 'back to the future' trilogy ,  'bill and ted's excellent adventure' ,  'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage ,  'window of opportunity' .  heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time .   in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film ,  '12 monkeys' ,  it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film .  repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind .   some ,  seeing the film for the first time ,  will regard cole ,  played by bruce willis ,  as a schizophrenic .  most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel .   unlike other time travel stories ,  '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past .  cole tells his psychiatrist ,  railly  ( madeleine stowe )  ,  that time cannot be changed ,  but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 ,  in his own personal time-line .   even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe ,  in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered .  .  . cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized .  if that's the case ,  time is like a fluid ,  it always finds its own level or path ,  irrespective of the external forces working on it .  it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much .   if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time ,  as we see on board the plane at the end of the film ,  then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events .  .  . or does it ?  the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
0	let's see where to begin .  .  .  bad acting ;  i'm not sure if i'd even call it that ,  as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read .  the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless .  sure there was a scene or two with nudity ,  but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters .   to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do .  the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants .   budget ?  did this movie even have a budget ?  it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home-shot youtube video .  bad lighting ,  props ,  poor sound post production .  bad special effects ,  if you want to go so far as to call them that .  story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so ,  but there was no life to this flick ;  i don't care who directed it .   i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom .  don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review .  check the ratings ,  you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between .  wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time .  what a suck-fest ! 
0	this movie sucked .  the acting sucked ,  the script sucked ,  and the movie overall sucked .  there were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening .   i'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out ,  but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are .  examples :   the heroine's negative comments about the hero .  the audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death .  the viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well .   also ,  all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes .  no explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them .   we gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back .  it was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it ,  so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment .   ; - ) 
1	 " the ladies man "  suffers a common problem among movies based on  " saturday night live "  skits .  and that is ,  a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes .  although this movie does have its laughs ,  like tim meadows as leon phelps ,  a sex-maniac straight out of the '70s ,  and will ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by leon .  so this movie is funny enough ,  but it's no  " wayne's world "  ! 
1	 " twelve monkeys "  is odd and disturbing ,  yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time .  it cleverly jumps between future and the past ,  and the story it tells is about a man named james cole ,  a convict ,  who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 .  at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr .  kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines ,  the insane son of a famous scientist .  being provocative and somehow so sensible ,  dealing with and between reason and madness ,  the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films .   the story is just fantastic .  it's so original and so entertaining .  the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named  " la jetée "   ( 1962 )  which i haven't seen ,  but i must thank the director and writer of the movie ,  chris marker ,  for giving such an inspiration for the writers of  " twelve monkeys "  .  i read a little about  " la jetée "  ,  it's not the same story but it has the same idea ,  so this is not just a copy of it .  david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story ,  which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end .  the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling ,  composed by paul buckmaster .   terry gilliam ,  who we remember from monty python ,  as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me ,  as i really never thought him as a director type of a person .  i know he has directed movies before ,  but i really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent .  it shouldn't be a surprise though ,  as he does an amazing job .  you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python's ,  but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing .  yes ,  it is indeed odd ,  weird ,  bizarre and disturbing ,  so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too ,  so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through .  it's not as heavy as you could imagine ,  but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch .  despite that ,  the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks ,  dreams ,  jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part ,  though it does need concentration from the viewer after all .   what comes to acting ,  well the movie doesn't even go wrong there .  the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis ,  who probably does his best role performance yet to date .  now people may disagree with me ,  as he did some fine job in for example  " the sixth sense "  as well ,  but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well .  the character is very well written too ,  yet performed even better .  cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself ,  starting to question his actual time of living ,  trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle .  by hardship he starts to loose his faith ,  questioning if he can even trust or believe himself .  other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt .  stow plays the role of kathryn railly ,  the psychiatrist of james cole ,  who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness .  she somehow starts to believe cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things .  brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date .  the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it ,  so i guess i'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing .   all in all ,   " twelve monkeys "  is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone ,  especially for the sci-fi fans .  it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances ,  especially from willis and pitt ,  and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever .  yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty .  it's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too ,  so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures i've ever seen .  through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride .  hard to explain really ,  but that's how it is ,  it's mind blowing . 
0	this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first :  charisma on the part of the leading actress .  this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man .  even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play .  it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors .  i just don't know .   but could it have been the screenplay ?  just exactly who was the chef in love with ?  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant ,  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits ,  than of anybody or anything else .  he never convinced me he was in love with the princess .   i was disappointed in this movie .  but ,  don't forget it was nominated for an oscar ,  so judge for yourself . 
1	as many reviewers here have noted ,  the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story .  i have never seen the stage version of the story ,  and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers .  perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film ,  but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas' show .  the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try-out group .  this way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try-outs .  douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part .  apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one ,  and the backstage cliché-ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added .  i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film .  the repeated intrusions cassie made during try-outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and/or luck .  however ,  this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past ,  and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again .  the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the  " i can do that "  number ,  but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories .  frankly ,  their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this .  *** of 4 stars . 
1	knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting ,  directing and acting .  and it's nice to see when a director/script get it right .  clocking in at just 82 minutes ,  10 items or less doesn't stretch the story ,  trying to grasp at inane topics .  it stays focused ,  being funny ,  sad ,  and well thought out .   morgan freeman  ( lucky number slevin )  stars as  " him "  ,  an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him .  we're introduced to  " him "  as he travels to a supermarket in an out-of-the-way section of town by the kid  ( jonah hill ,  click )  .  realizing he has a star in his car ,  the kid pressures him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years .  him isn't very forthcoming because ,  not only has he been out of it for while ,  he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in  (  " i haven't decided if i'm going to accept the part .  "  )  .  the kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville .  stuck ,  him decides to check out the local market .  he immediately runs into the beautiful scarlet  ( paz vega )  who operates the 10 items or less register .  not just strikingly pretty but intelligent ,  him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role .  he learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community .   but him doesn't just use scarlet ,  he helps her so he can see deeper into her life .  they travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband ,  and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for ,  and how to dress for success even when confronted with target as the epitome of local clothing .  this is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of him ,  too ,  showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world  (  " these shirts are only $12 bucks !  how is this possible ?  !  "  )  the ending ,  as stated at the beginning of this review ,  is abrupt but apropos .  there's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond .  they know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other .  it's a quiet but riveting moment as scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside him's l . a .  mansion .   this is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going .  and it won't waste your time either . 
0	zu warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid . the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something . whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god /demon/wizard thing . the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie . the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying , princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something . even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like  ( yes that's a word !  )  . i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand .  .  .  . who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all . it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time . i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu-yasha at episode 134 drunk .  .  . yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on . don't waste your brain trying to figure this out . 
1	while the premise of the film is pretty lame  ( ollie is diagnosed with  " hornophobia "  )  ,  the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick .  it's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one--probably since this was the last hal roach-produced laurel and hardy film .  in fact ,  it wouldn't be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films ,  as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos--something true laurel and hardy films never would do .  they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack .   stan and ollie work at a horn factory .  this sounds pretty funny ,  but it isn't .  not surprisingly with all the racket ,  ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work .  the doctor  ( james finlayson--in his last film with the team )  recommends an ocean voyage .  however ,  they don't like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock--then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother !  once they are on the boat ,  a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea .  fortunately ,  this portion of the film actually was well-paced and the very end worked out very well .   while not a great full-length laurel and hardy film ,  it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers  ( like in the devil's brother or babes in toyland )  .  additionally ,  there is still a decent amount of physical comedy--something you would see almost none of after this film .  part of this was due to the boys' declining health  ( and ollie's increasing girth )  and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films . 
1	the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa ,  but it is so much more than that .   anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things .  a longing for another ,  one of a different race ,  that cannot be consummated .  even a glance is forbidden .  there are no words needed .  their facial expressions say everything .   it is the story of a black servant ,  protée  ( isaach de bankolé )  and a white woman ,  aimée  ( giulia boschi )  .  their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other .   the little girl ,  france  ( cécile ducasse )  is lonely and spends all her time with protée .  she really can't see this dance .   one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials .  they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves .  there world is about to end ;  they just don't know it yet .  their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence .   i think i would like to visit this africa .  it seems so quiet ;  especially at night when you only hear the animals . 
1	this documentary was interesting ,  but it was also long  ( so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes )  ,  like ben-hur long .  but if your into that ,  this is for you .  but only if you have a passion for movies ,  like i do .  being that martin scorsese is my favorite director  ( live and maybe even ever )  ,  this is quite fascinating ,  especially if you know the style of scorsese's works .  because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films .  not the best documentary film ever made ,  but it is a leap for scorsese ,  which is always good to watch .  a
0	i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me .  i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable .  alive ,  like all of his films has an interesting plot ,  some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity .  however ,  these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive .  the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film .  unfortunately ,  the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going ,  before reaching fairly predictable places .  the action is just about passable ,  with the final fight pretty cool ,  and the earlier one about ok .  the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work ,  making for less coherency .  there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly .  the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring .  the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest ,  perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it .  with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller .  but the full length film is dull .  only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans . 
0	complete waste of time .  .  .  .  this movie is not comedy ,  it's not drama ,  it's not romance .  .  . not even teenage comedy at least !  !  !  story .  .  .  it should be some turn-over one end .  .  .  but it's so disappointing !  when movie has a turn-over on end i expect that turn-over to make movie even better  ( exp .   " fight club "  )  but this turn-over makes movie even worse .  .  .  .  when i watch teenage comedy ,  and i don't do that very often ,  i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness .  .  .  jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity .  .  .  you got only one .  .  .  . very good looking i must admit .  .  .  girl ,  and that's that !  and she's fully dressed whole movie !  acting is bad .  .  .  like soap series .  .  .  don't waste your time !  there are porns with better story and acting !    ( sorry on my bad english ) 
1	deanna durbin really did save universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio .  by the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at universal eg milestone ,  browning and wyler had gone .  only james whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him .  deanna and judy garland appeared in a short  " every sunday "  and initially garland was suggested for the role of penny in  " three smart girls "  .  when garland was unavailable universal switched to durbin .  initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star .  directed by henry koster the film had a european touch .   the film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in  " switzerland "  .  the  " three smart girls "  of the title - three sisters ,  joan  ( nan grey )  ,  kay  ( barbara read )  and penny  ( deanna durbin )  are sailing with penny giving her glorious voice to  " my heart is singing "  .  all is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman  ( binnie barnes )  so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse  ( lucille watson )  decide to go to new york and reunite him with their mother .  lucille watson is best remembered for her role as robert taylor's stern mother in  " waterloo bridge "   ( 1941 )  .   donna is a gold-digger who ,  along with her scatty mother  ( alice brady )  ,  is determined to marry judson craig  ( charles winninger )  .  for someone with no film experience deanna is wonderful as penny ,  a typical pesky ,  over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture .  when she sings  " someone to care for me "  to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had .  she also has one of the funniest lines in the film .  when her father consoles her with  " i'll take you to the zoo tomorrow "  ,  she replies  " oh i can see enough monkeys around here "  !  !  !   with the help of bill evans  ( john king )  they decide to hire a  " count "   ( mischa auer ) to romance donna .  they arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up lord michael stuart  ( ray milland )  is mistaken for the count and donna falls for him  ( she thinks he owns half of australia !  !  !  )  the plan backfires as he falls for kay and donna wants to hasten her marriage to judson .   penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away .  she is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of  " il bacio "   ( she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer .  )  everything ends happily with their mother  ( nella walker )  sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count  ( mischa auer )  and sails off to australia with him .   highly recommended . 
1	watching the commercials for this movie ,  i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it .  for one thing ,  it was one of those  " loosely based on the novel "  movies ,  which usually means that the book author saw the script ,  hated it ,  and refused to be associated with the film .  worse ,  the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable  ( ex :  kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose .  .  . and falls over )  .  so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the  " must see "  film of the season  ( of course ,  he thought the same thing about  " cars "  ,   " over the hedge "  ,   " the ant bully "  ,   " monster house "  ,  etc ,  etc )  ,  i was admittedly less than thrilled .   but once at the theater ,  the film won me over for a variety of reasons .  first and foremost ,  the writers capture 'kid dialogue' better than just about any other children's film i've ever seen .  a prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet .  the boys do a lame ,  over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them ,  which makes it realistic since all little kids think  ( mistakenly )  that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors .  then one of the boys asks ,   " why did he say ,  'alley oop' ?  "  another boy responds ,   " maybe he's crazy !  "  and the entire group laughs uproariously .  not an overly witty rejoinder ,  but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious .  as if to confirm it ,  my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen ;  i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation .   another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying ,  sibling relationships ,  the new kid in school ,  and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special .  for example ,  the bully  ( joe )  isn't stereotypical ;  he's definitely bad but not pure evil ,  and just enough of his home-life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins .  there's also no  " cue the dramatic music "  moment where billy  ( 'worm boy' )  realizes what a complete tool he's being to his younger brother woody ,  and yet ,  by the end of the movie ,  some type of minor transformation has been made .  there's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other ,  and very little of it comes across as corny .   the only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonald's dance party in  " mac and me "  would scoff at .  why oh why was it put into the movie ?  ?  did austin rogers  ( adam )  pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills ?  the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on  " the history channel "  .   overall ,  though ,  this movie was excellent ,  and the length  ( about an hour and twenty minutes )  was just about perfect .  one of the best ,  most realistic live action kid films you'll ever see if you're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like . 
0	the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way .  the script ,  the dreary pace ,  the lack of depth in any character ,  the pointless sub-plots ,  the dreadful acting ,  the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen .  i found nothing likable ,  enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way .   i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark ,  with its moody lighting ,  long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack .  if so ,  they failed utterly .  it just bored me ,  and i wish i had never watched it .   avoid at all costs . 
0	i'm always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes .  people who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst .   stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie i've ever seen ,  but it's up there .  first of all the sound .  the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing .  it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice ,  she could hardly be heard .   i usually like patrica and gaberial ,  but they were both flat in this movie .  patrica had basically 3 emotions .  quiet ,  in great pain ,  or really angry she has stigmata .  the first was the predominate one ,  the second involved screaming pain ,  the third involving raising her voice .  it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion .   maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about ,  or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style .  when you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story ,  in a 2 hour feature film ,  it's nauseating .  i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child .  and no pittsburg does not rain that often !  !   i think maybe a real story ,  with something to say could have been intended ,  but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms .  arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story . 
1	yet another example of what british cinema can achieve :  a simple story ,  told and acted well .  brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ,  ably assisted by a solid supporting cast .  the  " quirky small town "  card gets played to the hilt ,  similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years  ( ballykissangel ,  hamish macbeth and others come to mind )  .  like the forementioned ,  this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery ,  in this case the wet and wild cornish coast .   some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging ,  others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe .  but it's an enjoyable spliff ,  to be sure . 
1	this little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites .  i can watch it over and over .  dreyfus and braga are masterful ,  but raul julia steals the show !  a tongue-in-cheek ,  menacingly humorous gomez addams ,  with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story .   generally untrumpeted and unappreciated ,  moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen .  two thumbs up ! 
0	it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience ,  to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most .  however ,  this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan  (  who became annoying as hell in her own right  )  .  her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles .  this film might have been more ,  as there was suitable budget for settings ,  actors and a decent story line .  my wife and i both agreed that this was 'muck' at the end ,  as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high !  better luck next time ,  hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell . 
0	this has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made .  the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger 57 .  but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better .  the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way .  just a few of the awful moments in the movie ,  a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds ?  !  ?  thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet ,  thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience .  when on the runway  ( perfectly straight of course )  she is instructed to pull on the flaps ,  huh !  !  come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds ,  when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power !  i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie ,  but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary .  this is a movie you want to miss ,  take my word for it ! 
1	i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie .  for some reason it clicked on all my levels ,  tensions in a family ,  loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with .  it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire  ( cyndy preston )  .  i also bought the sound track to this movie  ( very hard to get )  .  loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv
1	i don't think this movie is for everyone .  but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny .  i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time .  i thought the entire cast did a great job .  you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene .  i suspect some moviegoers  ( especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously )  will be turned off by this brand of humor .  not me .  the movie was a real surprise .  and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change .  i cannot wait to see it again !  if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you .  funny funny funny funny ! 
0	this is listed as a documentary ,  it's not ,  it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming .  this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an  " american pie style comedy "  it's not that either .   basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid .  throw is a couple of dwarfs ,  also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls .   considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity ,  and practically zero sex scenes ,  mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty .   if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour ,  then this may be your thing ,  if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this ! 
0	with a title like  " attack of the killer tomatoes !  "  ,  anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a )  a bad science fiction movie or b )  a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies .  it's supposed to be a mix of both ,  with a dose of parody splashed in .  unfortunately ,  it falls flat very soon .   you're never supposed to take this movie seriously ,  i realize that ,  but you're supposed to think it's funny ,  right ?  i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny  ( i . e ,  the side-by-side phone conversations ,  the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal ,  superman walking by lois ,  etc .  )  .   " attack of the killer tomatoes "  strives to be a cult classic ,  but it doesn't make it .  a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it  ( or a similar description )  .   " attack of the killer tomatoes "  could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor ,  so therefore ,  it does not qualify as a cult film .   there is one good actress in the entire thing :  sharon taylor as lois fairchild .  she is a thin ,  gawky reporter ,  but has an endearing personality ,  loves to overact ,  and is a natural comedienne .  unfortunately ,  she is put to bad use here .    " attack of the killer tomatoes "  is not as funny as ,  say ,   " amazon women on the moon "  or  " kentucky fried movie "  ,  but it does have a few hilarious moments ,  so i would still recommend seeing it once .  avoid the director's cut ,  it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly  " lost "  footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect  ( it can be found in english on the out of print tape )  . 
0	this was just plain terrible .  i read this book for school ,  i made as on all of the tests ,  and to see it like this !  my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it ,  and it was worse than leonard part 6 ,  plan 9 from outer space ,  and hudson hawk put together .  the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over .  first of all ,  it was made on hallmark .  second ,  the acting was terrible .  third ,  it was like completely different from the book .  literally ,  it was so bad i asked myself to be excused .  basically ,  i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this .  take my advice ,  don't watch this film .  no one would want to watch this .  it was horrible .  horrible ! 
1	i like films that don't provide the typical  " happy ending ,  "  and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie .  alice marano  ( danes )  and her best friend darlene  ( beckinsale )  are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities .  the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether  ( or which )  of the girls was involved ,  and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer .  jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind ,  magnanimous wife ,  yon ,  who is also an attorney .  i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison ,  as another commenter has suggested ,  as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal .  where this film grabs me ,  however ,  is its ending .  alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned ,  and we  ( the viewers )  realize that they are both innocent .  any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me ,  and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving . 
0	you know a movie will not go well when john carradine narrates  ( a . k . a .  reads the script & plot synopsis )  over his character's funeral procession ,  a mere 5 minutes into the movie .  the narration is his character's last will & testament .  it stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants .  the children shall split $136 million equally ,  but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders .  if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants .  to be eligible ,  they must live in the family estate for a week .  it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show .   there is little subtext as to the nature of the deans .  they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family ,  but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog .  from the opening voice-over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending .    that journey is painfully slow and pointless .  we trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around ,  playing pool ,  throwing darts ,  the misuse of the  " through the fish bowl "  shot ,  dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men ,  constant bickering ,  misplaced circus music ,  bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux-german expressionism ,  the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting .  this all inevitably leads to the expected & ungratifying ending .  you will be happy to still be alive ,  but the pain might be too great to bear alone .  share children ,  share .   -celluloid rehab
1	zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about ,  it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b-movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick .  the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining ,  the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget ,  the gore is also great and gross ,  the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods ,  the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale .  zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there ,  if you love low budget b-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles . 
0	i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel & hardy's .  for me ,  it isn't as close to as bad as  " air raid wardens "  and  " the bullfighters "  ,  but there are some definite huge flaws in it .  the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio .  hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a  " london bridge "  dance ,  surrounded by 20th century fox starlets ,  while in the next room ,  laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit .  a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor ,  leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser .  then ,  in come the racketeers ,  now selling insurance covering up their protection racket .  one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum .  but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance ,  they are arrested .   this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio .  the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy's support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend ,  robert bailey .  they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents  ( matt briggs and margaret dumont )  and hopeful suitor allan lane ,  whom we can tell right off is a no-good swine .  this leads to briggs' hidden bar being revealed to tea-totaling dumont ,  and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below .  when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun ,  pandemonium ensues .  the dead-pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire .   later ,  hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so .  there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid .   ( even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman ,  after being arrested ,  their licenses would have been revoked )  .  laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog  ( only a frosting covered ,  cake devouring toto look-alike ,  or possibly the actual pooch )  ,  causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller-coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on ,  perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks .  roller-coaster gags can be exciting ,  as evidenced in  " abbott and costello go to hollywood "  ,  and this one is amusing but anticlimactic .   as the story wraps up ,  all of these gags seem to have no point ,  giving the impression that this was simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature ,  hopefully part of a double bill .  l&h ,  as i've mentioned in other reviews of their later films ,  had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach's employ ,  but surprisingly here ,  they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year .  had the gags not been as amusing ,  as was the case with some of their other films ,  this surely would have ranked a  " 2 "  as opposed to a  " 3 "  . 
1	i liked the quiet noir of the first part ,  the acting of pacino and cusak ,  especially their scenes together .  the moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting .  i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie ;  she was an earnest and appealing character .  the film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him meddling in .  nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard .  here the story became implausible .  something that i don't understand :  why did the cop and vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge ? 
0	i had the  ( mis ) fortune to see this film at a showing in the us .  having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing ,  i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb .    the original film was a turkey ,  but an interesting one .  it fitted into that early seventies ,  post 1969 revolution thing ;  this film just stinks of .  .  .  .  .  .  .   ,  well ,  nothing really .  it's that bad .   imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what i mean  ?   madonna never could act ,  and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years .  she looks worse and worse with every one of those years ,  increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat .   guy ritchie ,  who has built his  " reputation "  on lock stock ,  could never direct either - his movies are shallow ,  badly cut ,  fashion shows .  he doesn't disappoint here either ;  he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle .   please people ,  take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below .  they are quite obviously business plants .   don't encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money .   
1	i will always have a soft spot for this disney flick ,  another of their part live action/part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of  " mary poppins "  and never quite made it .  when i was in grade school ,  every once in a while we would have a movie day ,  where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria ,  and a movie would be projected the old-fashioned way ,  multiple reels and all .  at the time ,  it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived ,  and  " bedknobs and broomsticks "  is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way .   and from what i remember ,  it's quite charming .  angela lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent ,  and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed  ( boy ,  that could be misconstrued ,  couldn't it ?  )  who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far-off places .  come on ,  what kid wouldn't want a bed like that ?    grade :  a
0	i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg's appearance  ( a passionate fetish of theirs )  on the cover .  understandably ,  i did not expect much .  i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos .  however ,  my generalization was for the most part wrong .  unfortunately ,  this didn't make the movie any better .   most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama ,  whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick .  the film tells a story of two struggling writers  ( dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg )  who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces .  their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship .  this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder .  and although the movie is a drama ,  the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from snoop and company was more comical than anything else .   i wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that .  there are some mediocre conflicts ,  but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue .  the end ,  however ,  jumped at me with a sudden surprise .  it was a little bit twisted ,  somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end .  while watching the ending credits i couldn't help but picture the director thinking ,   " oh god ,  how the hell do i end this snoozer .  "  by the way ,  the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters . 
0	i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on ,  it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful .  i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be ,  surely it was deliberate .  i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish ,  unrehearsed ,  badly executed way that it was beyond belief .  this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas ,  think i am exaggerating ?  well give it airtime and think again .  dreadful ,  utterly dreadful .  if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again . 
0	i'm a fan of arty movies ,  but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel .  agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise ,  the experience is ,  shall we say ,  trying .  even after bad movies i feel that i learn something ,  or enjoyed some aspect ,  but there there was nothing to appreciate .  the premise was not uninteresting ,  but the movie starts and ends there .  the acting was ok ,  though the characters were utterly boring .  for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal ,  she is mightily empty .  pity .  i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic ,  but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content . 
0	not that i was really surprised .  .  .  . movies are never as good as the books that they originated from .  i was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books ,  even though i knew it would probably suck .  i was hoping to be pleasantly surprised .  however ,  they strayed from the book's storyline too much ,  and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was .  ending was different too .  lara flynn boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery .  the acting was unremarkable at best .  perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in lifetime's  " made for tv movie "  box ,  it would be a better flick .  if you saw this movie i highly encourage you to track down the book and read it .  i doubt you'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it . 
1	the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic .  i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - i felt i could get a real sense of the times ,  recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living .  it seemed worthwhile to experience .  the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect ,  perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film .  casting is great .  images are memorable .  acting is solid enough .  thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression . 
0	two films are useful for scaring people to god ,  this and 'event horizon' .  one has a significant and poignant message ,  the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get .  too bad paul anderson went on to the accursed resident evil movies ,  he really had something going .   thief in the night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes  ( acting ,  storytelling ,  dialog ,  and persuasion )  and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start .  the christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this ,  so we are stuck with the omega code ,  left behind ,  and the other tribulation movies .  their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message :   " get saved ,  folks !  "  that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a bible .   overall ,  i can't believe i'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective .  skip it entirely and go back to sam neil gouging out his eyeballs .  1 out of 5 . 
0	what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way ?  this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches :  unctuous priests ,  spitting before handshakes ,  town square cattle marts ,  cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music .  quickly ,  however ,  it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy-o of irish cliches - religous strife .  it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic-fathered child is educated ,  which would seem like a reasonable enough wish ,  though not to the '50's county wexford villagers she has to live with .  rather than send them to a catholic school ,  she decides to up and leave for belfast ,  then scotland ,  where a few more cliches are reguritated .  while she's there ,  her father  ( who looks eerily like george lucas )  and family back home are subjected to a boycott ,  which turns very nasty .  i'm not going to give away the ending ,  not because i think people should go see this movie ,  but because it's not very interesting .  one of the problems with the film is the central character :  we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life .  the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to ,  but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it .  in addition ,  it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process :  the woman is told by her lawyer that she  " must lay down preconditions "  for her return .  the film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively ,  and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches ,  in the past . 
0	the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel .   journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three  " london novels "  :   " absolute beginners "  ,   " city of spades "  and  " mr love and justice "  .  i have read all three .  the first two are excellent .  the last ,  perhaps an experiment that did not come off .  but mcinnes's work is highly acclaimed ;  and rightly so .  this musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy ,  badly-acted ,  soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london ,  and does nothing of the sort .   thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it . 
1	marjorie  ( a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett )  narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist joe  ( superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo )  .  however ,  joe steals her wallet and finds out where marjorie lives .  he pays her a visit one fateful day .  after subjecting marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse ,  marjorie manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the fireplace .  what is marjorie going to do with joe ?  director robert m .  young and screenwriter william mastrosimone concoct a harsh ,  gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity .  joe perceives women strictly as objects while marjorie only sees joe as an  " animal .  "  however ,  this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one-dimensional creep ;  instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid  ( joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant )  .  fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads ;  they receive fine support from diana scarwid as the passive terry ,  alfre woodard as the sensible patricia ,  and sandy martin as sympathetic policewoman officer sudow .  both curtis clark's agile cinematography and j . a . c .  redford's shivery ,  skin-crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension .  a real powerhouse . 
0	baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies .  the script ,  the music ,  just about everything in this movie is a waste of time .   the sound fx do not sound real ,  they stick out way too much  ( technical gadgets etc .  )  if they are trying to make a movie about things like this ,  at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps ,  because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that .  natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent ,  which gives it a void-like atmosphere .   directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film  ( i sure hope it was a low budget production )  ,  although it does seem fairly amateurish at times .   most characters seem empty and false ,  they simply haven't casted this movie very well .  i'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english ,  when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive ,  that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used .  i mean ,  could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent ?  it's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production .  the production team ever heard of subtitles ?  this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt ,  the societies as vulnerable and helpless .  i mean if the plot again goes like  " the interpol can't do jack ,  so let's call one american to bring down this international syndicate "  or whatever .   sony pictures treads on the same path as columbia before it ,  just producing movies for the hell of it .  i'd imagine them to have some self respect also .  are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because sony puts out something good a few times a year ?  !  maybe they should've used the same team as who were making di que si - say i do .  it's spoken in spanish and paz vega and santi millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat .  looks and sounds much better !  come on sony ,  wake up ,  produce less ,  sell more . 
0	i personally hated this movie because it was predictable ,  the characters were stereotypical  , and the whole idea was a rip off of  " the cutting edge "  ,  and  " cadet kelly "  .    the main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesn't belong .  the whole place hates her ,  and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn't like her  (  well duh the whole damn school can't stand you )  .  amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus ,  gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her .  then comes the choice ,  where she must choose between figure skating and hockey .  she chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals , and gets to be on the olympic team .  no real surprise there .   this whole movie was so damn predictable you knew what was going to happen before you even saw it .  this was so awful i nearly puked ,  and by the time i was finished watching it ,  i had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap .  don't watch this unless you are under ten ,  or actually like crappy tween movies . 
0	lame ,  lame ,  lame !  !  !  a 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long .  a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility  ( an abandoned convent )  is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky ,  witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip .  mostly it's just embarrassing ,  and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat  ( a sample of this movie's dialogue :  after demonstrating her artillery ,  fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante charactershe :  `any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck )  .  bad acting ,  idiotic ,  homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects ,  it looks like the director's watched `the evil dead' way too many times .    i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back .  what a turd . 
0	granted ,  i'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is ,  but a well put together ,  clever flick is worth the time .  my quibbles ,  in brief :   - dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character .   - unconvincing acting .   - storyline never really caught fire .   the writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films ,  tossed into a kettle ,  simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess ,  al'dente .   long and short ,  while not absolutely terrible ,  it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix rentals . 
0	sometimes a premise starts out good ,  but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder ,  it devolves into an incongruous mess .  and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after ,  this is a mortal shame .   so let's see .  premise :  a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop .  interesting to say the least .  make the encroaching cop a little disturbing ,  why not .  it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female ,  and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller .   now herein lies the dilemma .  create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous ,  or throw any semblance to reality ,  amp up the shock factor ,  and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age .   the producers ,  and directors ,  chose the latter .  thus is the resulting film -- badly made ,  with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before ,  and nothing much amounting to even less . 
1	you're using the imdb .   you've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films .   it's something you enjoy doing .   and it's all because of this .  fifty seconds .  one world ends ,  another begins .   how can it not be given a ten ?  i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight .  .  .  exactly how could the first film ever made be better ?  for the record ,  the long ,  still opening shot is great showmanship ,  a superb innovation ,  perfectly suited to the situation .  and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch .  all this within fifty seconds .   the word genius is often overused .   this is genius . 
0	for months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media ,  so i patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about .  after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie .  it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters .  with the possible exception of amanda peet  ( whose only redeemable quality is that she is amanda peet )  you cannot stand any of them .  the film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric ,  moronic ,  and crude .  the only slightly amusing character is eric ,  whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on .  the final twist ,  designed to make you laugh at the three main characters ,  only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards peet .  all in all ,  only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor . 
1	very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1/10 !  i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity ,  watch it .  .  .  don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing  " happy birthday "  and  " el payaso plinplin "   ( an argentinian song for kids  ( i think .  .  .  it could also be south american ,  i'm not sure )  )  .  this two songs that have the same melody .  .  .  but people don't usually realize that .  .  .  it's just grate !  i tried to write this in both spanish and english ,  because it's an argentinian movie .  .  .  but the page wouldn't allow me  :  (  hope you enjoy it ! 
1	preminger's adaptation of g .  b .  shaw's ''saint joan'' ( screenplay by graham greene )  received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day .  it was vilified by the pseudo-elite ,  the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant .  as in ''peeping tom'' ,  the reaction was malicious and unjustified .  preminger's adaptation of shaw's intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding joan of arc ( her actual name in her own language is jeanne d'arc but this film is in english )  is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play ,  not only on the literal emotional level but formally too .  his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions ,  the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power .  as such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters ,  including joan herself .   as played by jean seberg ( whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here )  ,  she is presented as an innocent ,  a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone .  as such seberg plays her as both saint and madwoman .  her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film ( which does show up in spots )  conveys the freshness and youth of jeanne revealing both the fact that jeanne la pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence .  by no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release ,  it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience .  shaw and preminger took a secular view towards joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist ,  not content with being a rustic daughter who's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields .  her faith ,  her voices ,  her visions which she intermingles with words such as  " imagination "  and  " common sense "  leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading englishman out of france .   and yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the dauphin ( richard widmark )  ,  the office of the clergy who try joan led by pierre cauchon ( anton walbrook ,  impeccably cast )  and the actions of the earl of warwick ( john gielgud )  then in joan herself .  the superb ensemble cast ( all male )  portray figures of scheming ,  machievellian ( although the story precedes niccolo )  opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends .  the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose .  john gielgud as the eminently rational earl whose intelligence ,  ( albeit accompanied by corruption )  ,  allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure joan gets burnt at the stake and anton walbrook's pierre cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty .  richard widmark as the dauphin is a real revelation .  as against-type a casting choice you'll ever find ,  widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied ,  comic caricature that's as close as this film comes to comic relief .  a comic performance that feels like an imitation of jerry lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of france .   preminger shot ''saint joan'' in black and white ,  the cinematographer is georges perinal who worked with rene clair and who did ''the life and death of colonel blimp'' in colour .  it's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film .  preminger's preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film ,  there's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-scene .   it also marks the direction of preminger's most mature ( and most neglected period )  his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work ,  how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles .  these themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers .  this is one of his very best and most effective films . 
1	this is an excellent film ! tom hanks and paul newman performed great ! i was really surprised when newman was beating on his son ! that was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good . i was very surprised about the end . rent this film today as it is one of tom hanks' best ! 
0	fred olen ray is a lousy director ,  even as far as b movie directors go ,  but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films .  yes ,  it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes ,  it is badly paced and uneven throughout ,  but it is also pretty entertaining .  scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty ,  fragile housewife whose worthless husband  ( jay richardson )  is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster  ( played by robert quarry )  .  delia sheppard ,  a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies ,  actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress .  you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic ,  robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes .  the ending didn't make much sense ! 
0	i just blew four dollars renting this movie !  why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me .  but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film .  i'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it's canadian and low budget .  it's like they expect canadian films to be lousy ,  so they give it a good review regardless .   now about the movie :  the acting was below average  ( with the exception of the lead male character ,  who was actually pretty good )  .  the film quality was poor ,  which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget .  the script was absolutely horrendous .  an example is the story ,  which revolves around one of the lead characters ,  a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang ,  whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suv's .  supposedly many of her gang members' bicycles are destroyed in these activities  ( i don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones ,  since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to toronto )  .   anyway ,  the point of the story  ( which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie )  is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable - as no one will want to live in the area .   - need i say more .   shame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film ,  telefilm for supporting it ,  and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews .   a film shouldn't get special treatment just because it's canadian !  !  !  ! 
1	`mad dog' earle is back ,  along with his sad-sack moll marie ,  and that fickle clubfoot velma .  so are babe and red ,  doc and big mac ,  and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard .  the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh's high sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame ,  and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original .   ( instead of walsh we get stuart heisler ,  for humphrey bogart we get jack palance ,  for ida lupino shelley winters ,  and so on down through the credits .  )  the only change is that ,  this time ,  instead of black-and-white ,  it's in warnercolor ;  sadly ,  there are those who would count this an improvement .   i died a thousand times may be unnecessary  and inferior  but at least it's not a travesty ;  the story still works on its own stagy terms .  earle  ( palance )  ,  fresh out of the pen near chicago ,  drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney ,  jr .   knocking over a post mountain resort .  en route ,  he almost collides with a family of oakies ,  when he's smitten with their granddaughter ;  the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame .  arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up ,  he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as winters ,  who throws herself at him  ( as does the pooch )  .  biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel ,  palance  ( to winter's chagrin )  offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity ,  a gesture that backfires .  then ,  the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath .  on the lam ,  palance moves higher into the cold sierras .  .  .  .   it's an absorbing enough story ,  competently executed ,  that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 ,  the year bogie ,  with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon ,  became a star .  and one last ,  heretical note :  those mountains do look gorgeous in color .   
1	eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell ,  a man who devotes his time to finding lost children .  when the beautiful kee nang {charlotte lewis} enters his life ,  she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child .  sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue ,  jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey ,  one that involves peril and worst of all ,  the demon sardo numspa .   is the golden child a product of its time ?  ,  by that i mean ,  was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences ?  .  for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade ,  it's box office was $79 , 817 , 937 ,  making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 ,  but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had .  the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop ,  but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking ,  quipping and charming best !  ,  seriously !  .   cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981 ,  the golden child hits all the required genre buttons .  pretty girl ,  daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury ,  dashing villain {charles dance so english i could kiss him myself} ,  wonderful colour ,  and a cute kid with mystical powers ,  the film only asks you to get involved in the fun ,  not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture .  yes the cgi demon looks creaky now ,  and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s ,  90s and beyond ,  but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious ,  seriously .  7/10
1	to all the haters out there :  condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages .  that being said ,  i was a huge fan of bsg ,  thought it was some of the best tv drama  ( not just sci-fi )  on the air .  but it was time for it to end and the story to move on .  i liked the bsg epilogue  " the plan "  ,  but it raised as many new questions as it answered ,  so i eagerly anticipated  " caprica "  and i was not disappointed .   i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg ,  and i was pleased that  " caprica "  is something different ,  and i personally found the story exciting ,  in a different way than blazing space battles ,  explosions and sci-fi special effects  ( don't get me wrong ,  i like that stuff too )  .  eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances ,  and alessandra was just wonderful .  i can't wait until next week . 
0	'major payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines .  this film does not really have a lot to offer ,  but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch .  don't expect it to be a memorable film ,  however .  just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people .  the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious ,  and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne .  again ,  it is not a great film ,  and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter . 
0	there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it's not very good .  limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal .  the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney's kim possible ,   ( brendan ,  the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible )  background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark ,  yet by today's standards ,  overall it is still poor and cheap looking .  many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80's ,  nice in its own way but for modern child audiences ,  used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind ,  is sure to disappoint .  the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive ,  noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part .  there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist .  however ,  some of the characters are good ,  the viking villains ,  although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound .  there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together .  the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off/homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay .  the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic/celtic/anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look .  the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner ,  including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive .  best of all though is the music ,  much of the background music is melodic and moving ,  specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers .  if the whole film was as poetic as this moment ,   ( and it tries ,  )  then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience ,  but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards .  overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways ,  but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment .  oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time ,  not sure how that was possible . 
0	i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role .  leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations ,  but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film .    actor miguel núñez who played little richard in  " why do fools fall in love ?  "  was a much more suitable choice ,  having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona .    if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well .  and this is what has happened here .  glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism .  what  " the temptations "  did so well in capturing the rise of the group ,  warts and all ,  this film misses by a wide mark .   what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with  " the hollywood shuffle "  ?  he's a talented ,  funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort . 
1	the bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged ,  inspiring such famed derivatives as cop land ,  the departed ,  the godfather 3 ,  and most recently of course ,  the wire .   with multi-faceted characters and story lines that have been described as '4-dimensional shakespeare' ,  the bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go .   the show covered ,  anticipated ,  and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010 .  the most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 ,  which aired on the eve of the second gulf war .  detective jim carver's misguided - and ultimately career ending - drugs raid on craig 'fun boy' richardson's flat in the jasmine allen estate in early 2003 ,  was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of iraq several months later .   however ,  it was the work the bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser-known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise .  this was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet-phobia ,  under-uniform cross-dressing ,  in-van homosexuality ,  lost truncheons ,  casual drunken bestiality  ( regretted )  ,  siren aversion syndrome  ( sas )  ,  groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many ,  many more issues that still trouble ,  disturb ,  haunt and excite officers to this day .   the last word should go to one of the bill's most famous fans ,  nelson mandela :   " it is no exaggeration to say that i would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on robben island if it wasn't for the heart-warming ,  casual buffoonery of reg hollis .  " 
1	i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own .  maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously .  i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites ,  dust ,  squalor ,  selfishness ,  rudeness ,  malice and decay .  i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction ,  his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager .  luckily for me ,  my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this  ( so far )  but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the  ( fake )  reality he is trying to convey .  simply put ,  the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race .  this film is the sum of many ,  many instances of great acting and great casting .  as some performances were done in english  ( the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others )  and others in french  ( with most other characters )  and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french ,  i heartily recommend ,  if you happen to be bilingual ,  to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa ,  during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd .  this film is part of polanski's so-called  " apartment building trilogy "  which also comprises  " repulsion "  and  " rosemary's baby "  .  unfortunately ,   " repulsion "  still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 .  needless to say ,  the three films would make a magnificent boxset . 
1	this film is one of tom cruise's finest films .  he captures the audiences imaginations with his role of david aames .  his character can relate to us all in some way . the story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film .  i never really watched cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent .  my favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth .  if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try .  it's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it .  my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did and it became one of my favourite films of all time .  it's a* 10/10 i promise once you watch it ,  it will stick with you and you will like it forever . 
1	i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films .  i would like now to retract that statement .  in my opinion now ,  the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas ,  am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful .  muppets take manhattan is nothing special ,  but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas .    the best songs are that 'you can't take no for an answer' song ,  the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself .  as i loved the muppet babies tv show ,  i loved the muppet babies sequence here  ( i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show )    the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper ,  with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding .  as kermit puts it in his final line 'what better way could anything end ? ' .  but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining .  there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats  ( choreographed by the late ,  great jim henson himself )  and the film certainly entertains .  i must state though that muppet movie ,  great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies . 
1	the performances in this movie were fantastic .  the dialogue was great .  jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as  " kid "  collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel .  far superior to  " the grifters "  ,  which was a good movie ,  this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came .  i recommend this movie to all film noir fans . 
0	another rape of history  this movie is a catastrophe ;  it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story ,  with bad acting and low budget production .   the movie should be 1/3 the time ,  they just dragged the time to make a mini series .   the battle scenes are so stupid and illogical ,  the solders log stupid ,  the costumes a catastrophe .  the romans were good in fighting in opened areas ,  one of their armies was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest ,  in this movie the romans choose to fight in side the city ,  i mean get real .   and by the way cleopatra was from a macedonian origin ,  which means a light skinned person . 
0	i read tom robbins' even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager .  i loved every word .  it was sexy ,  funny ,  and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing .  but when i saw the movie ,  i could not believe what a dull ,  sour ,  joyless piece of junk it was .  how did this happen ?  i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under  " gay pride -- women -- lesbians .  "   ( that's the library of congress subject heading .  )  now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians ,  any more than star wars is about real space travel .  the book was obviously -- and i do mean obviously --written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians  ( in the nude ,  all the time ) but has never really met one .   still ,  someone in hollywood said ,   " uh oh ,  better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble .  "  so they handed it to gus van sant .  nothing against the man ,  but -- however gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film .  gus van sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull ,  literal-minded lesbian power recruiting poster .  it's like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy .  not pretty .   the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting .  his clout allowed him to hire the very best .  his ignorance of the novel's real subtext  ( a straight man's fantasy ,  not a gay pride recruiting poster ) caused him to make choices that were not only bad ,  but bizarre .   let's meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues .   pat morita as  " the chink "  okay ,  there are few name-recognition asian actors .  and pat morita ,  in happy days ,  was fairly funny .  but casting him as the chink was wrong ,  wrong ,  wrong .  pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man .   ( gus didn't tell him .  )  pat also doesn't seem to know that the chink is  .   .   .  well ,  sexy !  !  !  in the book he's not wise old mr .  miyagi .  he's more like hugh hefner !  he's a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean .   ( you see ,  in the book ,  they aren't really lesbians .  do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet ?  )    john hurt as  " the countess .  "  okay ,  he's a gay friendly man .  but he is a serious ,  shakespearean actor !  !  !  !  you need someone who is fun ,  and camp ,  for this role .  for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad .  i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more ,  and sadly shake his head .   " now ,  richard ,  you know you've lost your soul entirely .  for shame ,  my former student !  "  and yes ,  john hurt was funny  ( and pretty gay )  as caligula .  but that was black humor ,  not playful and breezy humor like the book .   rain phoenix as  " bonanza jellybean .  "  no talent ,  no training ,  no problem .  except that in the book bonanza is funny ,  playful ,  cheerful ,   ( mostly )  heterosexual ,  and loving .  in the movie she's sullen ,  passive ,  expressionless ,  and dull .  as for her taste for women ,  robbins in the book puts it like this .   " god knows i love women ,  but nothing can take the place of a man that fits .  "  uh ,  gus ?  did you read this book ?    uma thurman as  " sissy hankshaw .  "  this is a tough role .  in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine .  still ,  a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye ,  or a sway in her walk ,  to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures .  uma doesn't pull it off ,  probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs .  uma plays it more like she's in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia .    this movie is sour and dull .  and i accuse you ,  gus van sant ! 
1	this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like  " the corporation "  and  " fahrenheit 9/11 .  "  its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature .  the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress .    truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children .  bravo !   nb - this is also the only film  ( of 8 )  at varsity theaters  ( toronto )  boasting a stick-on tag which reads .  .  .   " to arrange group viewings please contact .  .  .  .  "   .  .  .  a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem .   my bet .  .  .  an academy award nomination for best documentary .   ob101
1	the critics are dumb .  this movie is funny and smart .  i loved this movie a lot .  why does everyone hate this movie so much .  i wish people would love this movie more than they don't .  ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie .  i don't see you people out there making movies like them .  so people should just watch it and not comment it .  i like this movie .  it is ok through it all .  there are parts were it get's dumb but at least they made it .  jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens .  but this is better than that .  i can't believe this was rated so low . 
1	first and foremost ,  speaking as no fan of the genre ,   " the bourne ultimatum "  is a breathtaking ,  virtuoso ,  superb action movie .   secondly ,  it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff .   thirdly ,  the film carries a complex ,  important point ,  about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves .  no reference is made to abu ghraib or the executive branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights ,  none is necessary .   so ,  the latest in the  " bourne "  series ,  in the hands of paul greengrass  ( of the 2004  " bourne supremacy "  and last year's  " united 93 "  )  ,  is a significant achievement ,  perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre .    " breathtaking "  above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation :  for more than an hour from the first frame ,  the viewer seemingly holds his breath ,  pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless ,  globe-trotting ,  utterly suspenseful action .  there is no letup ,  no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film ,  and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes .   oliver wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of tony gilroy's screenplay from robert ludlum's 1990 novel  ( which doesn't stack up well against the  " bourne identity ,  "  written a decade earlier )  .   matt damon is once again the inevitable ,  irreplaceable bourne ,  the deadliest of fantasy cia agents ,  this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity ,  his past ,  and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine .  nothing like his quietly heroic edward r .  murrow ,  the always-marvelous david strathairn is the nasty top agency official ,  pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal  " take-no-prisoners "  policies and brutal procedures .   joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against strathairn's bad one .  and ,  there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to bourne's aid ;  a combination of greengrass' direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character ,  her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue .   so good is  " the bourne ultimatum "  that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit ,  this time stretched to ridiculous excesses ,  as bourne defies constraints of geography ,  time ,  gravity .  .  .  and physics in general .   ( can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building ?  why not - it looks great .  )    all this  " real-world "  magic - leaping from country to country in seconds ,  to arrive at some unknown location exactly as ,  when ,  and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities .  and yet ,  only a clueless pedant would allow  " facts "  interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy . 
0	i saw this film at the rotterdam festival ,  as did presumably all the other voters .  the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project ,  which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got .  it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite  " round the twist "  but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature .  the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states ,  as i can't think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic ,  poorly acted  ( albeit by an amateur cast )  and prey to the subaltern mentality .  the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over ,  but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in ,  all problems can be solved  ( by leaving the island )  . 
1	kurt russell's chameleon-like performance ,  coupled with john carpenter's flawless filmmaking ,  makes this one ,  without a doubt ,  one of the finest boob-tube bios ever aired .  it holds up ,  too :  the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age ;  carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll .   ( i'd been a borderline elvis fan most of my life ,  but it wasn't until i saw this mind-blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself .  it was quite a revelation .  )  elvis remains one of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time . 
1	i love this movie .  i mean the story may not be the best ,  but the dancing most certainly makes up for it .  you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them .  i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway .  .  . 
1	if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris & judson mills then this is the movie to see . it has a lot of adventure in it . it is a great follow up to president's man . the chemistry between the main three stars ( chuck norris , judson mills , jennifer tung ) is incredible . my personal opinion . this movie along with the original , has turned out so well , that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series . if you've seen president's man , i recommend this movie for you . if you've seen president's man : a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man , then let me suggest that you do . you will not be disappointed with either one . 
1	this series it's  " something different "  .  sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones ,  but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way .  edel & starck is great ,  it has all :  great plot ,  smart ,  witty ,  always well delivered lines ,  an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin ,  one of the most interesting city in the world .  it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once  " feel "  the old europe way of dealing with life .  kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come . watching the series in german is super . 
0	it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad .  .  the acting is very average ,  the story is horribly boring ,  and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution .  it was completely unoriginal .  o ,  and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant schwarzenegger !    one of the first scenes  ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ?  )  got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors .  if they were hoping for a career relaunch ,  then i think it might never happen with this on their cv !  the script had the potential ,  but neither 80% of the actors nor the director  ( who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor )  pulled it off .  fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest .   i'm sorry ,  but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic ,  because not only it's a total loss of time ,  but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like . 
1	actually ,  goldie hawn is from washington  ( takoma park ,  maryland )  ,  but i digress .  this is sort of a mr .  smith goes to washington type of movie ,  with some variations but the same premise .  i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn .  the story is interesting ,  but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life .  it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time .  it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous ,  i had to laugh .   ( possible spoiler ahead )  .  it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up .  and the speech she made at the end .  .  . beautiful .  too bad not many people have guts like that in real life . 
1	i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon ,  a part of the world that always has intrigued me .  i believe a condensed form of the book was published in  " reader's digest "  soon after the actual event occurred .   because i am a  " baby boomer ,  "  the character and the actress are my contemporaries ,  and for this reason i related to the film .  i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character's following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help ,  as well as other survival techniques .  most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude .  in conclusion ,  i hope viewers learn something from it ,  in addition seeing it for entertainment .   i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection .  it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels . 
0	99 . 999% pure crap .  and the other  . 001% was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe .  nope .   the dialogue was legendarily bad .  the action sucked ,  and there was no sex  ( the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed ,  alas ,  the whole movie )  .  the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i've ever seen on film ,  and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring .  acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis ,  the only 'names' in this movie .  and marina sirtis looked really ,  really bad .   i've seen high school plays more capably produced .  this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on .  heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air . 
1	this one is quite a nice surprise .  cute little story of the heroine's quest ,  very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen .    visually a sight for sore eyes ,  not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for  ( most of )  the costumes and make-up of the actors .  an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation .   back to the positives :  the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core .  loved that scene with the icicles ,  absolute classics potential .  a slight minus only for  ( very )  few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief .    9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect . 
0	this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i've ever seen .  and i'm quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus ,  when the scriptures  ( as well the other movies )  state differently .  it lacks also a very important issue :  the resurrection .  .  none of the other movies skip this very important part :  the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event .  as paul says in one of his letters  " if christ did not rise from the dead ,  our faith is vain "  .  a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem .    finally ,  and in opposition to my jewish co-commentator ,  jesus was not a myth .  and as a matter of fact ,  he was also a jew .  there are plenty of documents  ( relgious and secular )  that prove the existence of this extraordinary man ( or should i said ,  god become a man )  that indeed changed mankind .  i strongly advise him ( given he is a historian )  to read about flavius josephus ,  the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st .  century . 
1	the movie  " atlantis :  the lost empire "  is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently .  parents who have had to sit through  " the jungle book 2 "  or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one .   the film is one of few to attempt at an original story ;  previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories .  films such as  " toy story "  ,   " finding nemo "  ,  and  " monsters inc .  "  all do the same ,  but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney .  recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video ,  and are sequels to an existing successful film .  the quality of those films is given way to the profitability .  a new era started with  " atlantis "  following it were  " mulan "  ,   " lilo & stitch "  ,  and most recently  " open range "  .  the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past .   a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis ,  a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years .  including that of young milo thatch ,  voiced by michael j .  fox .  milo is employed by a museum in washington d . c .  .  his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist ,  who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis .  this was seen as a waste by his peers ,  and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps .  after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition ,  milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment .  she takes him to her employer ,  a mr .  whitmore .  whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather ,  and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis .  mr .  whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything .  the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers .  the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch .  the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis .  the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis ,  not just the discovery of people .  it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience .   the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation .  the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images .  a feat not easily achieved ,  most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two .  the characters are believably human .  there are some nice chase type scenes ,  with lots of action going on .  a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get .   the creativity of the writers really shines through .  the culture of atlantis is richly developed ,  including an entire language .  the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources ,  such as plato .  the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained .  believable ,  if by a younger audience ,  that magic really does exist .  the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic ,  but can best be described in this way .   although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic .  the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus ,  complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes .  the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology .  the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been ,  even holding roles in leadership .  this is not a bad thing .  it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to ,  rather than an all male cast .   one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ,  ever .  a tradition that began with the first feature film ,   " snow white "  ,  and carried on through to  " the lion king "  ,  almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs .  this is great and all ,  what would the seven dwarfs be without  " hi ho !  "  ?  after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without ,  but this one spares the parent .  not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song .  i for one am grateful .   the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike .  it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children . 
1	an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold .   people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed .   kitty  ( barbara bouchet )  is the suspect ,  but we know she is not the killer .  is it franziska  ( marina malfatti )  ?  is it evelyn back from death for revenge ?  is it a plot to steal an inheritance ?  the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia ,  who only did one other giallo ,  as far as i know .   the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out .  someone calls the police ,  and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty . 
0	when i was a kid we always used to be babysat ,  and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema .  this is one of the films we watched .  this is one of the stupidest films i've ever seen ,  i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film !  a martian is dropped on earth ,  turns into a human ,  befriends a human ,  and is trying everything he can to get back home .  but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth .  the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors ,  back to the future's christopher lloyd as the martian ,  uncle martin ,  dumb and dumber's jeff daniels as tim o'hara ,  elizabeth hurley as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie .  but apart from that it's complete crap .  poor ! 
1	page 3 **** out of 4 stars  madhvi  ( konkona sen )  enters her boyfriend's house and its empty .  she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture - 'ah !  another girl  that two-timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it's a guy this time around .  and i say 'brilliant ! '  end of spoilers  ( the above scene is not a spoiler really  .  .  .  but for me it was so i didn't want to take a chance )   when asked upon as how was this film ,  my friend answered 'oh ,  it just an exposé of the p3 people' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more .  when i went to the theater ,  i thought to myself '' i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film'' but i was proved entirely wrong and then some because i could muster only the goods .  this film was great .  great ,  not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands .   konkona sen sharma is grace .  she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part .  one of the most charming actresses i've ever seen .  but this is not the only performance which is good in the film ,  there's sandhya mridul ,  boman irani and atul kulkarni .  particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen .   ( and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normally )   the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about .  and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same .  but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it .  even boman irani agrees to that statement  'it was a good story ,  madhvi' .   ( thank you )  .  the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring .  in the end its all a roller-coaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people .  just the reason why i love watching films .  ecstatic film-making .  the screenplay is beautiful ,  clever and witty . 
0	i am so insulted by this movie ,  it's not even funny .  .  .  and i thought  " mulan "  was unbelievable !  however low my expectations of disney have become ,  i never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off .  there is no respect here for any true chinese culture ,  just the hollywood tradition of random martial arts .   i appreciate that they tried to make wendy into a normal teenage girl .  .  .  but ,  fortunately ,  most normal teenage girls--particularly asian teenage girls--are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life .  and from a cultural stand point ,  it's almost impossible .  yes ,  there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion ,  but they're pretty rare .  and even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars .  another stereotype ,  maybe ,  but a fairly true one .  because that's how chinese parents work .  that's how chinese values work .  if they wanted to go for authenticity ,  they would've made wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family .   this just adds to my frustration with american movies .  asian culture isn't about meditation and vague ,  nature-oriented phrases that sound wise .  we don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time ,  and we don't all know some form of martial arts .  we're a people ,  and i'd appreciate it if someone would write an asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature . 
1	it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie !  most of it takes place in a dream and ,  like most dreams ,  it's often foolish and illogical .  it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances ,  especially by our angel .   jeanette's deadpan ,  unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious ,  and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight .  at one point ,  she gets to sing a snippet from carmen ,  followed by the final trio of faust  ( holding a lapdog ,  for some strange reason )  ,  then  " aloha oe "  on the beach !    it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove . 
0	i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness .  of course ,  brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people .  no mention of drugs ,  prostitution or violence on these streets .  the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often .  brooks' movies have become worse and worse over the years .  this is just another nail in the coffin  . 
0	honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen !  this film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line .  i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from  " the omen "  and other movies like it .  for example the nanny  " lucy "  in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan .  .  .  .  . does this sound a lot like mrs .  baylock to anyone else .  another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted ,  just like in  " the omen "  .  however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body .  .  .  . yet another coincidence ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls ,  much like the priest in  " the omen "  having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper .  please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and  " the omen "  for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here . 
1	cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre .  much like other anthony mann pictures ,  the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery .  both of which play out amongst some of mann's peccadilloes like honour ,  integrity ,  betrayal and of course ,  death !  the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster {james stewart} and ben tatum {walter brennan} travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle .  aware of the blossoming gold-boom ,  they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town .  arriving in skagway they find self-appointed judge mr .  gannon {john mcintire} ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law ,  all be it with honest cause ,  along the way .  in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them ,  but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson-with gannon and his men in hot pursuit .  here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved .   interesting from start to finish ,  the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and mann's slick direction of the tight borden chase script .  the cinematography from william h .  daniels is superlative ,  tho not done any favours by current dvd prints ,  and the film has a few surprises and a  " will he wont he ?  "  core reeling the viewers in .  paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans ,  it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful ,  yet dark ,  western world of anthony mann and james stewart .  8/10
1	arguably this is a very good  " sequel "  ,  better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians .  it has good dogs ,  good actors ,  good jokes and all right slapstick !    cruella devil ,  who has had some rather major therapy ,  is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them .  many ,  including chloe simon ,  owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill ,  do not believe this .  others ,  like kevin shepherd  ( owner of 2nd chance dog shelter )  believe that she has changed .    meanwhile ,  dipstick ,  with his mate ,  have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies !  little dipper ,  domino and oddball .  .  .   starring eric idle as waddlesworth  ( the hilarious macaw )  ,  glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt  ( another baddie ,  the name should give a clue )  ,  this is a good family film with excitement and lots more !  !  one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick ,  but not quite as excessive as the last film .  this is also funnier than the last film .   enjoy  " 102 dalmatians "  !   : - ) 
0	a lot of promise and nothing more .  an all-star cast certainly by hk standards ,  but man oh man is this one a stinker .  no story ?  that's okay ,  the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks .  what ?  the action is terrible ,  corny ,  and sparse ?  dragon dynasty's releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema .  this is a blight .  they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs ,  but they can't bring life to a disjointed script .  there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying .  you almost feel like they're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters .  michael biehn is made of wood ,  really ?  sammo hung uses a stunt double ?  no way .  yes way .  stay away . 
0	the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing  " guess "  that location .  what toronto landmark will stand in for what american/international location .   who knew that the anti-christ would be russian ?  obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day - oh buck .  .  .  you'll tell us all the truth .  .  .  you'll show us the light .  .  .  and the way outta the building should those nasty anti-christers get their way .   five golden raspberries .  faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk !  we don't gotta prayer . 
0	class of '61   aspect ratio :  1 . 33 : 1  sound format :  stereo  in 1861 ,  class members from the west point academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the civil war .   gregory hoblit's ok historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted ,  despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers  ( clive owen ,  christien anholt ,  josh lucas ,  andre braugher ,  laura linney ,  etc .  )  ,  toplined by dan futterman as a conscientious southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery ,  pitting him in direct conflict with his former northern friends .  the movie's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave ,  but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial ,  and hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired . 
0	this movie is simply far too long ,  far too repetitive ,  with the male nudity and sexuality being  ( as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles )  far too gratuitous and unnecessary .  much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience  ( and stamina )  of an audience .   i saw this movie on an early saturday afternoon ,  with a film festival audience ;  the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome ,  interested in more experimental or atypical films ,  such as one without much dialog ,  shorts ,  foreign films .  the near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the  " pay off "   ( which never actually arrived )  ,  i have never ,  in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals ,  experimental ,  gay and otherwise ,  seen such a large number of people walk away from a film .    this movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was .  it also could have gone in different directions ,  still with a shorter running time ,  and been far more effective .   as it currently exists ,  this is not something that one can readily recommend or one i would have any desire to watch again . 
0	the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera .  deeply character-driven films are great ,  but only if the characters are compelling .  and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel .  the villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist .  the great lt .  columbo himself is no where near his famous ,  lovable ,  self-effacing ,  crumpled self ;  and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering ,  one-dimensional damsel-in-distress  ( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on !  !  !  i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds )  .  in any sense of reality ,  this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little .  and speaking of reality .  .  .  . the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police .  the police ?  ?  give me a break .  everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case .  this was no columbo ,  just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt .  columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours . 
1	this is a reunion ,  a team ,  and a great episode of justice .  from hesitation to resolution ,  clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny ,  to a superman who ,  like green arrow ,  sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ,  ready to save the whole planet .  this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork ,  loyalty ,  and friendship ;  this is also about deciding what's more important in life ,  a lesson for clark .  i do not want the series to end ,  but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any  " rewind "  pushes and put a good end here of smallville---and a wonderful beginning of superman .   in this episode ,  however ,  we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team .  nine stars should give it enough credit . 
1	and i really mean that .  i caught it last night on vh1 ,  and i was not expecting it to be so good .  this is now one of my favorites .  i must add that it has a killer soundtrack . 
0	if ,  in the first 10 minutes of this film ,  you don't realize that the main character ,  who writes a life advice column ,  is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself ,  then there is probably something wrong with you .  the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie ,  even if the rest of the movie was good  ( which it isn't )    there's almost no chemistry between the leads ,  and steve carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing ,  not funny .  it's hard to believe binoche's character would have any interest in him .  then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after .  isn't that great america ! 
1	malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere .  nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest .  soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell .  from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison .  that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light .   honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together .  anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast .  the kills are raw and eerie .  .  .  its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser .  malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint .  at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger .  .  .  when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal ,  so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be ?  with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do .  i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale .  several elements like the visitor with the camera ,  the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story .  anyway ,  i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette ,  although its a turn-off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of  " one missed call "  which was worn off and useless already in the miike-version . 
0	this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's  " hippie mentality "  in a nut shell and bores us in the process .  its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young ,  innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups .  a naive young hippy played by the waif-like  (  kay lenz  )  hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys ,  and then one day she meets the ridiculous  ( holden )  ,  already in old age ,  hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor ,  and she decides that she is in  " love "  with him .  if you think that is superficial ,  the whole film encapsulates such scenes .  she keeps saying how much she  " loves "  him and she only met him ,  it wears thin and really quick .  i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film .  its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place .  a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex ,  i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit .  a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film .  avoid this if you can .  grade d . 
0	un-bleeping-believable !  meg ryan doesn't even look her usual pert lovable self in this ,  which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick .  hard to believe she was the producer on this dog .  plus kevin kline :  what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ?  whoosh .  .  .  banzai !  !  !  finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill ?  must be a replay of jonestown - hollywood style .  wooofff ! 
0	every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films i seek out to watch isn't always impeccable .  i normally would stay away from stuff like this ,  but i was duped by some glowing reviews and the rohmer pedigree .   there's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted  ( digital )  back-drops of revolution era france .  this quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene .  what we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century france .  none of the characters are appealing or sympathetic .  the pace is so languid ,  the dialogue so arduous ,  and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to rohmer ,  that i ended up not caring whose head rolled ,  who was harboring who ,  or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about .  the movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score  ( there's some fine classical music used at the very end )  .  despite being so  " talky "  ,  the film plays much like a silent film ,  and the worst kind of film at that ,  a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects .  only the most astute french historians will find anything to take from this film ,  as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle  ( the lady is english and a royalist )  .  otherwise ,  avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia  ( i dozed off twice )  . 
0	i saw this movie in a theater in chicago and should have enjoyed it ,  since i love nemesis but if the first half an hour is skillfully done ,  the rest is just sub-predator video fodder ,  a long chase through those post-modern empty factories pyun affectionnates .  my girlfriend fell asleep .  i still like pyun though ,  but not this
1	first i would like to say how great this .  it is astounding and sometimes shocking .  and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie ,  i can definitely stand a boring film ,  but this is anything but boring .  it is like a trip through humanity .  its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece .  it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers  ( voight and hoffman )  who build a mutual friendship .  joe buck  ( voight )  a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women .  soon he meets rico 'ratso' rizzo  ( hoffman )  ,  who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent .  ratso becomes joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food .  as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is .  they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party .  joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso's dream spot ,  florida .  the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film .  from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life . 
1	much in the same way frank miller and his sin city comics used black and white to express itself  ( and its film noir influences )  ,  so does christian volckman with renaissance .   it is the year 2054 ,  in paris .  in the tradition of science fiction ,  the future is a bright ,  sparkling multi-teared jewel .  this is a jewel in a setting of misery ,  inequity and darkness ;  bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath .  one of these  " bright "  people at the top ,  a research scientist from a very large and influential global company  ( avalon )  ,  is kidnapped .  the well known and efficient ,  captain karas  ( voiced by the new james bond himself - daniel craig )  ,  is assigned the task to find her .   the plot and layout is not overly original .  it is heavily influenced by film noir ,  gibson's neuromancer and other detective stories ,  along with movies like blade runner ,  sin city ,  fritz lang's metropolis and minority report .  there is the main plot ,  surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end .  it is not hard to figure it all out .   the movie's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation .  paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels .  at its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure .  as the city rises ,  so does its architectural complexity and luminescence .  yet in this structure ,  the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior .  paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white .  the movie is closer in spirit with sin city  ( the comics )  then sin city the movie was with its source material .  this is done all the more easy ,  because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium ;  animation .  much in the same way as a scanner darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling ,  so does this .  the light and dark ,  black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts ,  as well as visual ambiguity .  right and wrong ,  black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us .  the movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time .   in keeping with the spirit of the movie ,  i can be both critic and fan .  i can love and loath in the same light .  it is definitely an experience i recommend for lovers of the visual arts .  so pour another black and tan ,  enter the void and enjoy the ride . 
0	i saw the movie last night and i really wanted to like it .  my expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since i heard it was being made .  some days i'd see something spectacular and some days i'd be disappointed .   yet being the kind of fan i am ,  i had high hopes for this movie but in the end i was sorely disappointed .   while i love the richard donner movies i didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to superman's character and his powers .   singer however chose to take the worst elements of the donner movies and put them in his version .   while his lex luthor is slightly darker he's still nothing more than a shyster ,  a conman and a common criminal .  he's no more intelligent than when gene hackman played him .  kevin spacey does his best to play luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog .   his henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen .  most of them literally have no dialog in the movie .   ****spoilers ahead**** kitty kowalski is almost exactly the same character as ms .  tesmacher .  she seems to be as evil and cold as lex luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays luthor .   the biggest disappointment in the movie was frank langella as perry white .  i wasn't a huge fan of the over the top perry white in the donner movies but at least he had a soul .  he was after all said and done ,  a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story .  langella's perry white is nothing but a corporate stooge .  he wants everyone to concentrate on the superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing .  he doesn't care about the real stories ,  the real mysteries like the black out and what lex luthor is up to now that he's out of prison .   the worst thing about langella is that he's dull !  some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep .  frank langella is puddle .   brandon routh is not a bad actor .  he's ok but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie .  not the actor's fault .  his movements are clearly meant to look graceful ,  like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies .  but it still looks choreographed and artificial .   lois lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by kate bosworth .  unfortunately ,  again ,  for a pulitzer prize winning journalist and writer ,  she is about as eloquent as any teenage on dawson's creek .   james marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie ,  mostly because he looks more like superman than even routh .  without any superpowers he manages to figure out lois lane's message ,  flies a plane to the location ,  gets on board luthor's yacht and rescues lois and her son .   the only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking .  you see them slowly going being immersed in the water .  you know superman's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them .   as i said before the plot is very haphazard .  unlike singer has said ,  this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world .  as soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms .  lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back .  even luthor is happy to have superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel .   superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe .  a big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum ,  lex luthor is out of prison ,  he now has knowledge about superman's powers and weaknesses ,  and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know luthor would be using kryptonite against him .   according to the movie the only thing superman is good for is lifting really ,  really heavy things .  the action sequences are all incredibly predictable . 
0	they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is ,  hands down ,  the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen .  it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone .  even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable ,  this one was completely out of place .  compare this to legendary episodes like  " a stop at willoughby "  or  " midnight sun "  ,  and you realize there is no comparison .   buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material ,  and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode .  even though he seemed to be giving it some effort ,  he must have needed the money .  .  .  there's no other explanation . 
0	this movie is terrible .  terrible .  one of the worst movies ever .  i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this .  previews made us say  " no "  ,  but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now ,  we decided to go ahead and give it a shot .   stupid us .   affleck is not an actor .  he's an image and can look good with explosions ,  but not even the kind bruce willis got in  " die hard "  .  if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys ,  it would be a comedy .   the best part was catherine o'hara -- she's always good .  gandolfini flops again  ( if it weren't for the sopranos ,  he'd be washed up )  like he did in  " the mexican "  .   affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions .    avoid this movie at all costs . 
0	for the first time in years ,  i've felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review ,  because it was just such a let-down to watch .  the plot sounded awesome when i read it ,  i expected a minimal mystery thriller ,  a claustrophobic phantom hunt .  unfortunately ,  it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane ,  tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth-gnashingly stupid  " no-one-says-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies " -dialogs that it's just agonizing .   here's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film :    - the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable .  no ,  actually ,  it's angering .  and lazy .   - related to that :  cheap thrills .  a long parade  " just in time "  moments .   - the main characters .  alright ,  it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life ,  but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies .  thus ,  his characters are boring ,  lifeless second generation clichés .  they are mere plot-devices ,  place-holders without the slightest bit of personality .  they are  " man and woman in break-up who still love each other "  .  never seen that one before except in 100 , 000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable .  think of the blandest two-dimensional hollywood fare and you've got it .  there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh ,  charming ,  or interesting .   - the far-fetched ,  vague resolution that's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple ,  though the word  " resolution "  might be ill-fitting here ,  because the movie is a swampy mess that isn't going anywhere anyway .  by the time you're through ,  though ,  you don't care anymore .  the last third of the movie i just fast-forwarded ,  because it was just so unbearable to watch .   okay ,  that's it .  whatever redeeming features this movie has ,  it all gets buried under incompetence .  don't watch this turd . 
0	nell shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the maxwell automobile's off-road capabilities .  the plot of the movie is pretty simple ,  nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block ,  and needs inspiration ,  so she goes to visit mexico to absorb the atmosphere .  there she meets the hero  ( bert van tuyle )  ,  a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse .  while nell is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp ,  a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness .  the hero needs to get to her quickly ,  so he decides to drive there in his car .  this is where the film takes a weird twist .  bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable ,  huge rocks ,  small streams ,  heavy brush ,  scraggly tree stumps ,  steep inclines ,  etc etc ,  for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles .  now mind you ,  this isn't a modern-day atv ,  it's a 1920 maxwell automobile ,  so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle .  and it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters ,  we get to see it stuck more than once in this film .  but the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles .  once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl ,  he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit  ( on horseback )  ,  and at this point it became hysterically funny to me .  watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks ,  getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush ,  going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs ,  the bandits should have had ample time to catch up .  but they never do ,  even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night .  and in a silly climax ,  the car climbs a mountainside ,  and helps nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits .   after seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than hummers and bradley tanks combined .  watch this film just for laughs ,  it's worth it just to see nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying  " you did your best ,  brave little car " 
1	actually this movie has silly moments ,  both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part ,  and it's much worse than other mj movies like  " the wiz "  ,   " captain eo "  and  " ghosts "  .  but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years ,   ( yeah ,  that's half my life ,  you guys !  )  ,  i can't complain too much about it .  just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me .  but as a movie ,  it's not good at all ,  and i'm afraid ,  that it would get a much lower grade for me ,  if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it .  but since no one but mike is the moonwalker ,  it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me . 
1	this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best .  at the same time ,  it looks realistic and unrealistic ,  just knowing that the movie is fake .  the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways .  a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address ,  and it includes a manga video ,  showing the torture .  the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die .  some scenes are shocking ,  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times ,  because you see punches in nearly every movie .  this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older .   9/10

1	the main problem of the first  " vampires "  movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic .  carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire .  the female vampire una certainly is the coolest vampire since blade's deacon frost .  unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene  ( why didn't carpenter use more of this ?  ?  )  this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been .  i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence  ( for example inside a city )  and was left somewhat disappointed .  while  " los muertos "  proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor ,  it still drags a little in some parts  ( though nowhere near as bad as  " vampires "  did )  .  much like  " vampires "  however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense .   most of the above may sound like  " los muertos "  is a bad movie but it definitely isn't .  it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre .  it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake  ( like almost every other vampire movie out there )  nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like blade ii .  it simply could have used a bit more excitement .   i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen .   spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable .  una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual . 
1	batman and superman .  iconic .  the better part of a century old .  who doesn't know of these two ?  there must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them .  sandy collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film ( which does not exist ,  and is not being created ,  much less by this team )  .  perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is .  throughout ,  the cinematography is solid .  the editing is spot-on .  the production values ,  even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character ,  are quite high .  it looks quite  " hollywood "  ,  this trailer .  the physical types fit for ,  as far as i can tell ,  every single character .  the lines are reasonably written .  the shots are well-thought up ,  nicely achieved and fairly effective .  however ,  this does have problems ,  and in spite of looking good ,  it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of grayson ( which only had the problem of teeter-tottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer ,  as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas )  .  the acting is perhaps the most evident .  it's .  .  .  not good .  even some of those who only have one line and/or hardly appear on-screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance .  the actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent .  then there is the writing .  really ,  the plot ,  well ,  what minuscule amount there is ( this and this character team up ,  something about some evil plot .  .  .  )  is fine .  there is a problem in the characterization .  while most characters seem to fit ,  two-face is ,  well ,  about as much as a cackling lunatic ( which is quite simply ,  as far as i've understood ,  not what the character is )  as he was in batman forever ( and having your work on portraying any element of the batman universe compared to joel schumacher's efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan )  .  also ,  putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film ( honestly ,  collora is practically *begging* for it with such a similar initial reveal )  to be made ,  and ,  let's face it ,  this loses in every respect .  michael antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that tommy lee jones does ,  and the make-up ( which ,  in aforementioned reveal ,  is essential )  isn't as strong as that of the film ( whether or not it was good in the film is another matter )  .  the sad thing is that while fiorella ( john ,  who created grayson )  seems to be far more into the comics ,  and get them ,  the depth of them ,  better ( not to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot .  .  .  grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films ,  or more )  ,  collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one who's more likely to have contacts ( on account of having non-indie credits on his filmography )  to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer .  i intend to watch other of collora's work .  but fiorella is the one of the two whose work i will most definitely be most interested in .  i recommend this to fans of the characters .  7/10
1	in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective .  one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography ,  is coup de torchon ,  the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine .  claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine ,  the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects .   i was struck with the dignity of potee ,  with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses .  i was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and aimee .  it is the latter that gives the film its driving force ,  it is the latter that links this movie to indochine .   one never is sure what motivates everyone ,  though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism .  it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon .  theirs is the more scandalous story ,  perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way ,  but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships .   the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa .  he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother .  he was coming home ,  but they just thought him to be a little daft .  france ,  the character and the girl ,  grew up in cameroon ,  but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .   
0	no cinematic achievements here ,  however that's not even the important question .  how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle ?   the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston--check ;  there's a built-in tv audience !   add thick-headed ,  compliant men ,  usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée--check .    assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars .  so far ,  so good .   what is the male lead to consist of ?  he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience  ( and the gay flight stewards )  instantly swoon .  but .  .  . he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience ,  and he can't outshine the star .  roll cameras .  .  .   the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom .  .  . she has only one presentation :  as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of .  a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene ,  where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds .    you can't help feeling good for mulroney .  .  . you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this .  he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime  . 260 hitter .  this time ,  he smacks one out to the warning track ,  and no one can figure out what to do ,  as he amusedly takes home plate . 
1	there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly ,  one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building .  each character unfolds more and more each series .  also each series has an array of different 'small time characters' as well as the main .  a good example of a character  ( who was only in three episodes )  who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick .  every little detail builds the perfect tv series .  the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano  ( james gandolfini )  who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two .  the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable .  whilst tony runs things with capos paulie  ( tony sirico )  and silvio  ( steve van zant )  his nephew christopher  ( michael imperioli )  looks for a promotion .  every episode also features tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano  ( edie falco )  .  on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano  ( dominic chianese )  is trying to get what he can out of tony's businesses despite being under house arrest .  all the acting is powerful and characters complex ,  but the two who stand out the most are ;  james gandolfini who 'is' tony soprano .  also michael imperioli who plays christopher ,  representing the younger  ( 20-30 )  generation in crime .  if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed ,  such as the wire and dexter .  so the sopranos is definitely the godfather ,  goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
1	after seeing 'break a leg' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film .   i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos  ( eric roberts in particular )  were a scream .  i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close .   the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations .  the script is smooth and seamless ,  the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh .  this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in ,  which is around 10 - 15 or so .   i highly recommend 'break a leg' . 
0	  although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful ,  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story .   one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know ,  but i doubt it .   one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations ,  but my experience has been ,  more often than not ,  teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world .   one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake ,  but i think not .   one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into ,  and hang around inside ,  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble ,  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents ,  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this .   one final nit ,  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome .  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome ,  but because it was never detailed ,  each reference distracts from each scene .   this movie did not ring true for me . 
0	you've gotta hand it to steven seagal :  whatever his other faults may be ,  he does have good taste in women .  if you pick a seagal movie ,  chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it .  and usually ,  they do not function as mere eye candy ;  they get involved in the action and fight ,  shoot guns ,  kill with knives ,  etc .   " flight of fury "  offers the duo of ciera payton  ( who has a very sexy face ,  with luscious lips to match angelina jolie's )  and katie jones ,  and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling !  and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them ,  it's because the rest of the movie ,  although passable ,  is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about .  ironically ,  the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself ,  who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care .  this being a military-type actioner ,  there is very little fighting in it ,  and he doesn't fit into his role  ( a stealth fighter pilot ,   " the best in the world "  ,  of course )  very well ,  which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .   ( *1/2 ) 
1	heres a fun fact ,  i was the baby in the movie ,  the one in the crib .   :  )  i am 19 years old now .  my parents took me to try out for the part ,  we lived in texas at the time . i think i only made like 80 bucks for it ,  but i wasn't in it very long .  my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry .  i was all mixed up .  strange and funny fact i suppose .  .  and no i am not a child actress .  i am livin' in san antonio ,  workin' at a walgreens .  i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life .  this movie is a great movie ,  though ,  good concept .  i have seen it several times in my short 19 years . 
0	i watched this .  .  .  . let me rephrase .  .  . suffered through this because i'm a fan of eva's .  i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos .  i like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close .  the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars ,  and that money was probably spent on the caterer .   the premise was interesting ,  but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not .   i won't bother saying who did what and how ,  because it isn't worth the effort .  i'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this garbage .   oh !  !  before you flame on me ,  i love movies ,  i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed ,  so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know . 
0	around the late 1970's ,  animator don bluth ,  frustrated with the output his company ,  disney was churning ,  defected from the mouse house to form his own studio .  his first production ,  the secret of nimh ,  was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day .  this was followed by an american tail and the land before time ,  both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful .  although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh ,  they still are very charming ,  enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups .  but before long ,  don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven ;  critics were especially harsh on this film ,  and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney's the little mermaid .   considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title ,  one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare .  instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling ,  deceit ,  crime ,  mistreatment ,  and murder .  that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say ,  but it does call into question over whether the film is for children .  on the other hand ,  it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven .  in short ,  it's a movie with a major identity crisis .   set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans ,  the movie starts out when charlie b .  barkin ,  a rough-and-tumble german shepherd ,  is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner ,  a nasty ,  cigar-puffing pitbull ,  carface .  before you know it ,  charlie finds himself in heaven ,  albeit by default .  here a whippet angel ,  annabelle ,  tells him that  " all dogs go to heaven because unlike people ,  dogs are usually loyal and kind .  "  this line represents the confused nature of the movie ,  since the dogs in the movie ,  the whippet aside ,  are presented as anything but .   upon realizing that he's been murdered ,  charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface .  with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy ,  charlie  " rescues "  carface's prize ,  annemarie ,  a human girl who can talk to animals  ( in order to predict who will win the rat races )  .  charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family ,  but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down .  although he refuses to admit it ,  charlie does grow to love annemarie .  .  .   the concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution .  aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through  ( with the vocal pipes of ken page )  ,  none of the other characters emerge as likable ,  nor frankly ,  are even worth caring about .  unfortunately ,  that also applies to charlie ;  in trying to make him an anti-hero ,  the script  ( composed by more than ten writers )  only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable .  as such ,  the audience feels no empathy for charlie ,  and worse ,  his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing .   ( further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds .  )  besides the lack of an endearing lead ,  the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story .  the slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time .  the aforementioned musical alligator  ( who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats )  seems to have been thrown in from nowhere ,  as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza .  the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft ;  a bit more polish could have made this a tighter ,  impactful story .   matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t . j .  kuenster  ( annemarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones ;  the latter in particular benefits from ken page's mellifluous vocal )  or the uneven voice cast .  as mentioned ,  burt reynolds' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further  ( the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end )  .  dom deluise as itchy is pretty good ,  but he's had better roles ,  notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh .  ken page ,  as mentioned ,  is awesome in anything he does ,  but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best .  similarly wasted are loni anderson  ( as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie )  ,  melba moore ,  and charles nelson reilly .  judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable ,  partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show .   barsi aside ,  the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation .  technically ,  this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth's team  ( by 1980's standards ,  that is )  ,  particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon .  if anything ,  the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling .   on the whole ,  however ,  i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment .  even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion ,  the overall package is not in the same league as bluth's better efforts .  animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry ,  but by the time it's over ,  all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth . 
1	i've been intrigued by this film for a while ,  in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb -- a 9 . 0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film !  how had i not heard of this film before this website ?  well ,  you can't always trust the ratings .  this is actually a very good film ,  preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals ,  especially william haines as brown ,  and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard/yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 .  obnoxious ,  self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place ,  becoming in the process a caring ,  self-sacrificing friend ;  i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels ,  the predictability factor is high .  still ,  it starts out very well ,  and is certainly deserving of being remembered ,  if not praised to the heavens .  maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men .  .  .   edit now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9 . 2 !  seriously ,  folks ,  there is ballot-stuffing going on here - i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than  " metropolis "  or  " the general "  ! 
0	i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again .   i have seen action films ,  i have even liked quite a few of them ,  but this one goes over the top .   not only does it have the worst male actor ever  ( sly stallone )  playing the lead role ,  but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning  ( why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground ,  would be hell of a lot easier )  that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it .    furthermore ,  the plot has no real twists at all ,  a three year old kid could guess what comes next .  it is a set of cliches  ( of action genre )  ,  with sly performing even worse than his other movies  ( he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film )  .  now there is an actor who can't act a )  surprised b )  sad c )  anything else than his basic face .    i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it .  explosions are outstanding ,  but then .  .  .  you can see better on the 4th of july .  landscapes are magnificient ,  but then .  .  .  there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas ,  so you can see better sights that way ,  rather than waste time on this flick .   go watch some other movie instead ,  there are hundreds ,  even thousands better action movies . 
0	**1/2 for this diane keaton farce .   someone should tell ms .  keaton ,  enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats .   this flick is just too much as keaton's daughter ,  sara ,  dies in a traffic accident ,  while her boyfriend survives .   keaton ,  who could not be reached by phone at first ,  as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug ,  grieves in a new way for grievers .   she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara's friends are staying .  she cleans the house ,  sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed .  it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter .  in addition ,  she had an abortion thanks to this guy .  we're all now put on this guilt trip .   her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept .  she also hopes that boyfriend , adam ,  who is a playwright ,  will not include all this in another play .   when the diary is found ,  it has been written in japanese .  sara had a ph . d in this language .  it's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant .   naturally ,  everything seems to tie up nicely in the end .    the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz .  every time mom and sara would speak ,  they would both utter surrender dorothy .   as if this isn't enough ,  during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning ,  keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film ,  interiors ,  where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman .  ms .  keaton also tries drugs with the group .  come on ,  folks ,  can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this ?    fair to mediocre best sums up this film . 
1	last christmas ,  i was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday .  given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it ,  i was somewhat wary of approaching  " the bourne ultimatum "  but i really shouldn't have been worried .  the electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story-lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series .   jason bourne  ( matt damon )  returns after an apparent leak about operation blackbriar - a new program based on the old treadstone project - to the journalist simon ross  ( paddy considine )  at the guardian .  determined to uncover more about his half-remembered past ,  bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director noah vosen  ( david strathairn )  believe that bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour .  can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good ?    personally ,  i felt slightly disappointed with  " the bourne supremacy "  as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film .  not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic  " bourne identity "  ,  it seemed more like a slow-burning spy novel rather than an action-thriller .  no such worries here - every car crash ,  punch ,  kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully ,  it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around .  it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films ,  providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed .  performances throughout are nearly faultless - even julia styles begins to offer something more than book-wormy eye-candy .  the only real downer is that this ,  like the other bourne films ,  has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die-hard ludlum fan ,  this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre .   nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears ,   " the bourne ultimtum "  is a cracking movie filled with enough bone-crunching action to satisfy the meat-heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute .  even at the final reel ,  you're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not  ( and if not ,  what more do you want ?  )  ,  this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can .  no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty-odd years of movie history in order to start again .  bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until  " casino royale "  gave the bond series the reboot it desperately needed .  missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the dvd .  not the ultimate bourne collection though - limited edition ,  i'm afraid ! 
1	the funky ,  yet strictly second-tier british glam-rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's .  the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's :  morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck ,  vain ,  neurotic ,  pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries  ( and fails )  to pursue a floundering solo career ,  paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt ,  and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living .  former loving groupie turned patient ,  understanding ,  long-suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised ,  largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe .  our lovably ragged bunch try gamely ,  but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day .  scraggly zonked-out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy ,  trouble-plagued ,  but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride .   director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ,  ringing ,  flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general ,  this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve .  the astute ,  sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity ,  capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow .  ashley rowe's lovely ,  elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb .  kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered ,  but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success .  all in all ,  this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's . 
0	there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival .  it is dull ,  plodding and lacking in suspense .   peter oõtooleõs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interest .   note  :  some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson ,  best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series ,  in one of his earliest roles .  .  .  . 
1	i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it !  bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl .  this is parminder nagra  (  " er "  ) 's breakout role ,  playing jess ,  a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football  ( that's soccer to us north americans )  .  and even though she's actually much older than her character ,  she plays the role pitch-perfect .   this is a movie about friendship - specifically jess's friendship with jules  ( keira knightley )  ,  her teammate who is also going through family issues ,  especially with her mom ,  who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes ,  and who wants jules to be more feminine ,  wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian .  jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams .  they also ,  unfortunately ,  both love the same man - joe ,  their coach  ( played by jonathan rhys-meyers )  .  the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship .   in some spots ,  bend it like beckham falls into clichés .  in others ,  scenes drag on far too long ,  and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing .   but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up ,  culture clash ,  and the love of football .  it's about female empowerment ,  chasing your dreams ,  and supporting your friends .  funny ,  charming and fun ,  bend it like beckham is the little film that could .  .  .  and did .   excellent .  8/10 . 
0	one question :  why ?  first off ,  the premise is not funny or engaging at all .  they use taped interviews ,  and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts .  first off ,  the interviews aren't funny or entertaining to begin with ,  and even if they were ,  i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally ,  without being turned into cartoons .  how does that add any hilarity to it ?  i turned on cbs's monday night sitcom line-up ,   ( which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays )  and found this on .  of course ,  the sitcom line-up would be reruns anyway ,  being summer ,  but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining .  i tried to give  " cc "  a chance .  i really did .  when it started ,  i figured ,  well ,  maybe it will be funny .  nope .  and then it kept going .  it was a long half hour .   and i can almost see if there was a purpose ,  if the interviews were shown in their entirety ,  and had points to them .  but no ,  it was just one-line clips ,  cut and pasted together really quick .  it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network's  " robot chicken .  "  i wasn't a fan of cbs' now-cancelled sitcom  " the class .  "  while that was on ,  it was one half-hour of the line-up i would struggle through .  but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of  " creatures "  .  .  .  . let's just say i'd take the  " class .  "  considering it's been a couple hours since it aired ,  and i come on here to see i am the first to comment .  .  . i guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it ,  and that it won't last much longer .  cartoon roadkill . 
1	ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film ,  to catch action ,  characters and setting on the hoof ,  as they emerge .  covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia ,  unformed in mind or manhood ,  this is an ideal approach .  the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities ,  adulthood and relationships .  lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent character ,  enduring the strife like a hardy parent .   james schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film ;  close behind it are a number of well-appointed performances that carry it admirably .  jeffrey wright's name alone could carry this film for me .  he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role :  instead we are treated to very good  ( if not revelatory )  performances from a large ,  often recognisable ensemble .   a noble ,  optimistic film .  one to watch if you don't fancy the harder ,  more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim ,  for example .  7/10
0	in 1454 ,  in france ,  the sorcerer alaric de marnac  ( paul naschy )  is decapitated and his mistress mabille de lancré  ( helga liné )  is tortured to death accused of witchcraft ,  vampirism and lycanthropy .  before they die ,  they curse the next generations of their executioners .  in the present days  ( in the 70's )  ,  hugo de marnac  ( paul naschy )  and sylvia  ( betsabé ruiz )  and their friends maurice roland  ( vic winner )  and his beloved paula  ( cristina suriani )  go to a séance session ,  where they evoke the spirit of alaric de marnac .  they decide to travel to the villas de sade ,  a real estate of hugo's family in the countryside ,  to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure .  they find alaric's head and the fiend possesses them ,  bringing mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices .  after the death of her father ,  elvira  ( emma cohen )  recalls that he has the thor's hammer amulet hidden in a well ;  together with maurice ,  they try to defeat the demoniac alaric de marnac and mabille .   last weekend i bought a box of horror genre with five dvds of paul naschy per us$ 9 . 98 ;  despite of having no references ,  i decided to take the chance .  the first dvd with the uncut and restored version  " horror rises from the tomb "  is a trash b  ( or c )  movie that immediately made me recall ed wood .  the ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay ,  direction ,  performances ,  cinematography ,  decoration ,  special effects and edition and with lots of naked women .  the result is simply hilarious and i can guarantee that ed wood's style is back .  my vote is three .   title  ( brazil )  :  not available
0	i read rice's novel with interest ,  and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths .   however ,  i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation .  the casting was based merely on physical appearance ,  and not acting talent  ( with the obvious exception of peter gallagher ,  who was neither blond-haired ,  or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag )  .  the cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious ,  but not in an entertaining way .  i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe ,  and was surprised i made it to the end .   a warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one . 
0	can fake scenery ruin a picture ?  you wouldn't think so ,  but it actually for me in here .  listen ,  i have a lot of classic-era movies and i know pretty much what to except ,  such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen ,  etc .  but a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes .  to have fake scenery ,  fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in  " brigadoon "  gets insulting after awhile .    as far as the music entertainment went ,  this is always subjective .  what songs one person likes ,  another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film  ( whether someone likes the songs )  .  i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs ,  dances ,  romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things .  musicals did very well in the '50s .  me ,  i liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps .  by the '50s ,  tap was out and this new stuff - which i can stand - was it .  does that make this a lousy movie ?  no .  it just makes one i didn't care for very much  despite the good cast ,  good director and high expectations ,  this film bombed at the box office ,  and with me .  i should have liked it more ,  being a dreamer myself and that's a nice part of this story .  i am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal .  then why couldn't i connect with this film ?  part of it also was the dancing .  i don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen .  but - no - the thing really turned me off what that staging .  there was no scotland ,  no highlands ,  just a hokey- looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start .  score one point for today's realism where they  " go on location "  most of the time . 
1	escaping the life of being pimped by her father (  .  . and the speakeasy waitressing ) who dies in an explosion ,  lily powers ( barbara stanwyck ,  who is simply ravishing ) sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham .  when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law ( and lily's new lover )  ,  the sky's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands .  newly appointed president to the bank ,  courtland trenholm ( george brent )  ,  sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough ,  but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love .  this makes lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way .  though ,  circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches .  . trenholm ,  now her husband ,  is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank .  he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing .   stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish .  being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy .  good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act .  obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily's dead heart .  that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me .  she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him . 
0	first of all ,  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema ,  which is because ,  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline .  this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos ,  as the director and marketing ads imply .  in my mere opinion ,  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale ( in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country )  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant .   however ,  the acting is near perfect .  in fact ,  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked ;  talent !  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job ,  even the less experienced ones .   ( like janset )  at least ,  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation  ,  just because he knows well how to choose the cast .  other than that ,  he is just a media monkey ,  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent .  come on ,  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women .  and just because media boasts off ,  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema .  just close your ears and o something real artistic ,  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work .  hope ,  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach .   in short ;  pros > good acting ,  hot women  ( just kidding !  )   :  )  cons> each and every single thing ,  other than the cast
1	i have to hand it to the creative team behind these  " american pie "  movies .   " direct to dvd "  typically is synonymous with cheap ,  incompetent film-making .  yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel  " the naked mile "  .  the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy ,  yet funny little film .  this year they offer up the followup ,   " beta house "  .  this is the honest truth ,   " beta house "  makes the first few  " american pie "  movies look like  " the little mermaid "  .   this is no holds barred ,  tasteless ,  laugh-out loud fun .  sure ,  the story is a bit thin ,  but that's the beauty of the whole thing .  within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters ,  the new supporting characters ,  get a handful of raunchy gags ,  meet the villains ,  and establish the general plot-line .  with all that out of the way ,  the movie becomes a no-limits ride .  the gags are a plenty ,  and they did not hold back in this one .  i'm talking male semen ,  urine ,  dildos ,  chicks-with-dicks ,  sex with sheep ,  female orgazim sprays ,  and plenty more .  not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene .   returning from  " the naked mile "  are john white ,  jake siegel ,  steve talley ,  and eugene levy  ( in a similar supporting role as the last few films )  .  the entire cast does fine work .  steve talley  ( dwight stifler )  ,  in particular ,  has a great energy and screen presence .  i predict good things for him .  the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open .  by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was  " the deerhunter "  parody .  classic .   the bottom line is ,  if you're a fan of the series ,  you'll feel right at home with  " beta house "  .  it really pushes the limits of good taste ,  but in the end is pretty damn funny . 
0	a disappointing film .   the story established our protagonist as chrissy ,  a 'young' ,  rather sullen individual drifting ,  not doing much .  actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives .  it's a pity though ,  chrissy seem like interesting character .   story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated .  so the question now is ,  when are we going to see the campions ,  jacksons ,  and the tamahori's breaking ground with compelling ,  cinematically-told stories that will inspire ,  rather than entertain for the toll of two hours ?   technically ,  a disgusting shot film . 
0	i really wanted to like this film ,  but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant .  the new york times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers' cartoon  ( 'hello my baby ,  hello my darlin' ,  hello my ragtime gal .  .  . ' )  .  but i challenge anyone to watch the fox/blue sky animated feature robots  ( 2005 )  and not find ridiculous similarities in :  storyline - a young inventor growing up ,  and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions .   cityscape - extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments .    .  .  . robots .  .  .  - the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots ,  and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look .   all of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end ,  implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back  ( which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other ,  with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity )  .   the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own ,  and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction ,  as though we don't have the attention span for anything less .   the villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated ,  and he's a pleasure to watch .  much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together .  some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid-90s .   the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short .  by the end of this cartoon ,  we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue . 
0	i love the munna bhai mbbs but  " lagge raho .  .  .  "  sux really sux .  i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life .  and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers  ?  ?    **may be spoiler**   an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai ,  people discussing their personal prob .  on phones come on man from which part of the world u r  ?  ?  ?  i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible .   2 out of 10 .   ( 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting ) 
1	this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages .  the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age ,  in ancient rome and in the present  ( 1920s )  .  in all three cases ,  he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love .  of the three time periods ,  i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest .  i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the snow--but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton's amazing acrobatics .  however ,  all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film ,  while not his best ,  is still an exceptional and enjoyable film .  check it out ! 
0	despite pretty bad reviews ,  i just had to give this film a go  it does ,  after all ,  star hk super-babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars .  surely that's worth checking out ?  well ,  as babe-fests go ,  martial angels is hard to beat .  the eye candy is top quality .  shu qi looks as fantastic as always ,  and of the rest of the girls ,  rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular .   unfortunately ,  if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits ,  it is an absolute stinker !  the story is weak ,  the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic .  director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else .   if shu qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one ,  you would be better off watching sex and zen 2 again ! 
1	great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced .  montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf' police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and ,  most importantly ,  credibility .   when a typical hollywood cop-heroe loses family ,  friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief .  but when the sixty seconds are over ,  he pulls himself together ,  packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one .   montand's marc ferrot ,  however ,  is really devastated - by his girlfriends murder ,  of course ,  but also by finding out that she had another lover . in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene .  thus all his actions become unescapably logical .  this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one . 
1	inspired at least a little by ivy benson & her all girls orchestra ,  who performed throughout the war years at the covent garden opera house ,  this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the  ( almost )  all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of wwii .  all too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music ,  and help to fill in the background to the band members ,  and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer  ( who is trying to dodge the call-up )  .   ian holm  (  " lord of the rings "  ,   " cromwell and fairfax "  )  and judi dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed elizabeth ,  and the conniving ,  womanizing patrick ,  the drummer .  the late joan sims is perfect as the band's leader ,  now playing bar piano at the sea-side ,  and june whitfield glows as the salvation army trombone player .  cameo appearances by other greats like cleo laine ,  leslie caron ,  olympia dukakis and billie whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience .  the movie is a romp down memory lane ,  with an all star cast of what ought ,  by all rights ,  to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses .  all i can say is ,  i hope i look as good at their age !  leslie caron ,  in particular ,  is still an incredible fox ,  at 69 years of age .  she certainly still gets my pulse going !  as i watched it ,  i was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age .  afterwards ,  i looked these girls up ,  and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the london of 1944  ( although this might be a bit of a stretch for judi dench )  .   if you like swing bands ,  thrive on nostalgia ,  or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her ,  don't miss this film .   
0	this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared .  .  . as in ,   " was it as stupid as revolver ?  "  i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense .  jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose .  within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy  ( of soprano's fame )  which makes no sense at all !  then there's some shooting and then there's ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs ,  then there's some animation ,  ray liotta's naked butt ,  lots of shooting ,  teeth gnashing ,  art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing .  .  . which i'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for .  .  . not 5 times anyway .  everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he's yogi bear incarnate .  the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight !  the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it . 
0	this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the bar .   the film is quite frankly boring .  what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it .  the film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film .  did i say it was boring already ?  if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional attachment to any of them .   there are about 4 good minutes in this movie ,  but that was about it .  this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance ,  but i held on believing that it had to get better .  i was wrong .   the sort of film you could threaten naughty children with . 
0	in the opening scene of  " malta story "  mr a . guinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be  " certain women need striking regularly - like gongs "  or some such world - weary bon mot . unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life . indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one . and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie . mr j . hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a  " jack hawkins "  performance without an ounce of individuality . it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies . many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose .  the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees . the courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george cross . a worthy subject you might think for a movie , but  " malta story "  does not even qualify for the term  " worthy "  in its most patronising sense . it gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline , perhaps before the actors lost the will to live . 
0	 ( review in english ,  since swedish is not allowed )   i saw this movie with extremely low expectations ,  and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them .   as much as i loved to see janne  " loffe "  karlsson on the big screen again ,  the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water ,  isn't original or funny .  the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable ,  the ones that ain't ,  is just plain boring .  i smiled like three times during the entire film .   the placement of swedish findus products is  ( unintentionally )  funny ,  why not just a big sign saying ;   " findus made it happen !  "  .   göta kanal 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd ,  just wait for it to air on tv ,  it wont take too long . 
0	well ,  you know the rest !  this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time .  i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role .   the lead role is played by  ( to me )  a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey .   bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques .  this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts ,  however ,  even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch .  an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing .   sorry ,  the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year . 
1	updated from a previous comment .  the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late  ( 1928 )  silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines .  davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines ,  a bit player in crude comedies .  they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is  " discovered "  and becomes a big dramatic star .   a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions .  davies & haines are a wonderful team ,  and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin ,  douglas fairbanks ,  william s .  hart ,  john gilbert ,  elinor glyn ,  norma talmadge ,  mae murray ,  rod larocque ,  leatrice joy ,  dorothy sebastian ,  estelle taylor ,  louella parsons ,  renee adoree ,  aileen pringle ,  and marion davies  ( you have to see it )  are a hoot .  a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies !  dell henderson plays the father .  polly moran is a maid .  paul ralli is the slimy leading man .   show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model  ( i think mae murray is closer )  .  davies and swanson were friends .  but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one-reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b .  demille films of the late teens and early 20s .   davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends .  odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie .  they're great together !  a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood .  greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear . 
0	let's face it ,  romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies  ( just look at the academy award nominations each year )  .  but still ,  the good ones are truly an art form .  look at  " when harry met sally "  ,   " sleepless in seattle "  ,  and classics like  " roman holiday "  and  " it happened one night "  .  i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness .   this movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy .  but no one believes the romance between the main characters ,  and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming .  modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead .  i'm sure as executive producer ,  he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself .  and gershon .  .  . i see possibilities of some comedic talent ,  but she had no script and a poorly developed character .  and whose idea was the english accent ?  pointless .   others have stated it ,  but i want to repeat :  this story is poorly conceived ,  poorly executed ;  the actors are terribly miscast ;  and the characters ,  well ,  we just don't give a hoot about them .   an art form this ain't .  go rent  " moonstruck "  again . 
1	went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon i like films that deal with sleazy , loser characters and this is full of em .  after a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual 'bellini' that both makes and lets the film down .  the 'bellini' is one of the funniest scenes i have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall 71/2 out of 10
0	i saw this movie once ,  and i thought it was ok .  then my friends at work said  " watch it again ,  it's better "  .  so i did .  and to my surprise ,  it was worse on the second time !  there's a word limit ,  so i'm going to get the ball rolling here .   -the bombing scenes were all so stupid .  why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion ?  ?  ?  -none of the characters here are even remotely likable .  not on the first time ,  not even the second .   -oh ,  and last time i checked ,  a car does not explode from a single gun shot ,  nor can a fire that huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher .  .  .  did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie ?  ?  ?  -the camera is so shaky ,  i can barely tell what is going on .  that opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put ,  the rest of the movie was not much better .   -the sniper scene .  the mcmanus brothers  ( from  " the boondock saints "  )  would roll their eyes ,  it was so stupid .  first off ,  why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot ?  furthermore ,  why would he spend that much time cleaning the bullets ,  reloading ,  aiming and not get shot ,  when there was so much chaos going on around him ?  -sas types running instead of staying and fighting back ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  huh ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  are the soldiers .  .  .  gay .  .  .  ?  ?  ?  i didn't mean to sound homophobic ,  but honestly ,  that scene was so ridiculous .   -too long for its own good ,  yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it .  bigelow seems to think that the more action ,  the better .  looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot .  i know watchmen is longer at 163 minutes ,  but at least that movie didn't drag .  this movie ,  on the other hand ,  does ,  and for it ,  feels longer .   the only good thing was renner ,  who was satisfactory at best .  but do yourself a favour ,  just skip this ,  and don't give into the hype . 
1	honestly ,  i was expecting to hate this one ,  and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it .  .  . but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed .  a group of college kids and their teacher go on a  " field trip "  to ireland .  their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace .  the group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid b-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one .  .  .  first off ,  there is plenty wrong with evil breed .  the acting/dialog is pretty weak ,  and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson ,  chasey lain ,  ginger lynn ,  and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here - and jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped ,  as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time .  even less with chasey ,  and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever .  also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film .  those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well .  richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on ,  with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half  ( though how she ends up this way isn't shown on-screen )  .  .  . not bad for the first 5 minutes .  the other kill scenes are pretty inventive ,  including jenna's forced breast implant removal ,  a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass ,  a knife through the face ,  and a few other notables .  the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em ,  so to speak .  also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored .  the  " creature "  fx are also done competently which definitely helps .  overall ,  evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected .  this one ,  along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low-budget straight-to-video films .  i usually steer clear of them as a whole ,  but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith .  evil breed is no masterpiece ,  but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - i know i was ,  and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience .  7 . 5/10
1	this is john waters best film to date .  the characters are obvious and symbolic ,  just as in his other films .  so there are no surprises or character changes .  i enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story .  it was good story-telling with honest people . 
0	quite possibly .  how francis veber ,  one of the best comedy directors in the world  ( at least when sticking to his native france )  ,  managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern .  it's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit :  it's genuinely physically painful to watch ,  such an endless parade of inept writing ,  acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers .  for once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story .  what were they thinking ? 
1	caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for .  many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see .  the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre .   it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself .    an absolute diamond ,  a film i still have on video to this day .  check it out . 
0	the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar  ( but superior )  'the legend of suriyothai' set box office records .  the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest ,  pedestrian scripts and story development on film .   the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma  ( gary stretch )  whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked ,  captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria  ( cindy burbridge )  with the consent of her father phillipe  ( john rhys-davies )  ,  a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses .  there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong  ( dom hetrakul )  ,  after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness ,  are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards ,  only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan  ( yoe hassadeevichit )  reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat  ( oliver pupart )  to take over the rule of siam .  yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families  ( tong's wife and children and fernando's now firm love affair with maria )  with the expected consequences .   the acting  ( with the exception of john rhys-davies )  is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp .  the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog ,  making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles .  the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas .  but if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching .  it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions .  it is just the basics that are missing .  grady harp
1	i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this .  but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is .  this hbo special features him teaching  " american history "  to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal .  he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u . s .  but some other parts of the world .  this documentary/comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true .   i enjoyed how mr .  wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting .  i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her beliefs . 
0	i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap .  what a waste of time .  beverly d'angelo and william katt ?  wtf ?  were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something ?   truly ,  a piece of unfunny garbage .  the characters were stereotypical without meaning to  ( i think .  .  .  )  and wooden ,  most of them seemed like they were on autopilot .  the so-called  " hilarious "  situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed ,  i weeped for the writers .   i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time ,  seriously .  i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 ,  it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock . 
1	i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed .  there are not much movies i like ,  but i do like this one .  you should see this movie by yourself and comment it , because this is one of my most favorite movie .  i fancy to see this again .  action fused with a fantastic story .  very impressing .  i like modesty's character .  actually she's very mystic and mysterious  ( i do like that^^ )  .  the bad boy is pretty too .  well ,  actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld' .  i considered about the vote of this movie ,  i thought this is should be a very popular movie .  i guess wrong .  it was me who was very impressed about this movie ,  and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one .  see and vote . 
0	i've seen some crappy movies in my life ,  but this one must be among the very worst .  definately bottom 100 material  ( imo ,  that is )  .   we follow two couples ,  the dodds  ( billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene )  and the kirkendalls  ( patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy )  in one car on a roadtrip to reno .   apparently ,  lonnie isn't too happy with his sex-life ,  so he cheats on his wife with candy ,  who's despirately trying to have a baby .  roy ,  meanwhile ,  isn't too sure if his sperm is ok so he's getting it checked by a doctor .   now ,  i had read the back of the dvd ,  but my girlfriend didn't ,  and she blurted out after about 20 minutes :  'oh yeah ,  she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's' .  spot on ,  as this movie is soooo predictable .  as well as boring .  and annoying .  meaningless .  offensive .  terrible .   an example of how much this movie stinks .  the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada ,  when they are stopped by 2 police-officers ,  as they didn't stop at a stop-sign .  the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer .  not only is this scene pointless and not important  ( or even relevant )  for the movie ,  it takes about 5 minutes !  it's just talk and talk and talk ,  without ever going somewhere .   i still have to puke thinking about the ending though .  apparently ,  roy isn't having problems down there so he is the father of the child .  how many times does that happen in the movies .  .  .  try something new !  the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after .  yuck .   best scene of the movie is right at the end ,  with a couple of shots of the grand canyon .  why couldn't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes ?   one would expect more from this cast  ( although thornton really tries )  ,  but you can't really blame them .  writers ,  shame on you !   1/10 . 
1	i love this movie .  my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed .   it's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another frank sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing .   i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice .   stubby kaye's  " sit down ,  you're rockin' the boat "  is a foot-tappin' ,  sing-a-long that i just love .  he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best .   vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and  " adelaide's lament "  is my favorite of her songs .   i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part .  maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part ,  it made sense .   michael kidd's choreography is timeless .  if it were being re staged in the year 2008 ,  i would not change a thing .   i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage ,  even though it was on film .   i thought the movie was well cast .  i performed in regional versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period . 
1	this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society ,  rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life .  in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool's junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents ,  who have been dealt with under this scheme ,  have not committed a second crime .  however ,  this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem .   stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer .  this hard-boiled character is a role typical of baker .  having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer .  however ,  as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events ,  back to his original investigation .   his first case leads him to the home of two young children ,  mary and patrick murphy  ( played by real-life brother and sister duo )  ,  who have committed a petty theft .  here he meets cathie  ( satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood )  their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with .  it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency .   the elder brother of the murphy family ,  johnny ,  is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums .  mccallum does an eye-catching turn as the americanized mixed-up kid ,  who owes more to the likes of marlon brando ,  than any previous british star .  one is reminded of brando's character johnny from 'the wild one' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'johnny' leads his gang .   thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as 'the blue lamp' is not so apparent .  instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront .   the plot ,  whilst at times predictable ,  does deliver some memorable scenes .  the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music ,  leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant .  the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children ,  including mary and patrick ,  are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny .  obviously in the light of the real-life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying .  understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences . 
1	a lot of people unfairly sh ! t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining .  devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video's vintage and low-budget .   let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know :  this film is an  " extreme "  torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid-80s .  it's plot as it stands is simple :  a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is .  this entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound .   the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground .  these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings .   the actress who plays the victim of the  " experiment "  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera .  her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling .  some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest .  also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes .   if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot .  8 . 5/10 for devil's experiment . 
1	the shining is a weird example of adaptation :  it has very little in common with the source novel ,  written by stephen king ,  yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work .  this is due to two factors :  stanley kubrick's masterful direction and jack nicholson's chilly acting .   nicholson plays jack torrance ,  a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period ,  unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place :  he claims a nice ,  isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book .  therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family :  jack ,  his wife wendy  ( shelley duvall )  and their five-year old son danny  ( danny lloyd )  .  the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong :  he has been told by the cook ,  dick o' hallorann  ( scatman crothers )  that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy ,  the titular shining ,  which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future ,  among other things .  because of this  " gift "  ,  the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny ,  even though he is quite capable of resisting them .  that is not jack's case ,  however ,  as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts ,  triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break .   the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick ,  though having never worked on this kind of film before ,  knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't ,  hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths .  king criticized the director for changing most of the story ,  omitting most of the jack/danny subplot  ( merely hinted at in the film )  that led to the book's emotionally strong climax ,  and while his disappointment is valid ,  the omission was actually necessary :  the novel dealt with redemption ,  albeit in an unconventional way ,  and redemption is a theme kubrick ,  one of the most famous analysts of human decay ,  never had a soft spot for .  what he is interested in is the mental ,  and subsequently physical ,  unbalance that threatens the characters ,  and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot  ( danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example )  .   another criticism king raised was about the actors ,  especially nicholson :  in the writer's opinion ,  his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane ,  thus undermining the rest of the story .  now ,  it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning ,  but it is equally true that martin sheen  ( king's ideal choice for the role )  probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson's :  from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal  " here's johnny !  "  scene ,  it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part ,  and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn't bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo's nest star .  as for duvall and lloyd ,  both add terrific support ,  the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens  ( the omen's damien )  and haley joel osment as cinema's great horror child icons .  one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart  ( blonde and beautiful )  and not having much else to do but scream and run ,  but two things ought to be considered :  a )  back in 1980 the  " scream queen "  cliché wasn't one yet ;  b )  rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera ,  making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy's eyes .   irvine welsh ,  the author of trainspotting ,  once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work  ( and he should know ,  given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen )  ,  yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad .  the shining proves said point to perfection :  very little from the novel ,  approximately 5% ,  is included in the film ,  but in kubrick and nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest ,  most original horror pictures of all time ,  which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form . 
1	whilst reading through the comments left for this show ,  i couldn't help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will .  the thing about kerching !  is that it's a children's show ,  for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy ,  forced ,  and probably stupid .  i even found one person saying the sets were stupid ,  but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall ,  and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine  ( they didn't )  .  yeah ,  it can be annoying ,  the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair ,  but as a kids show ,  i rate it 10/10 .  compared to the stuff they air in its place today ,  well ,  lets just say i wish it'd be re-aired .  dvd release ,  anyone ? 
0	this guy has no idea of cinema .  okay ,  it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth ,  and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship .  this all is very good ,  but look carefully :  he does not know his job !  the scenes are unbalanced ,  without proper start and and ,  with a disordered content and full of emptiness .  he has nothing to say about the subject ,  so he over-licitates with violence ,  nakedness and gutter language .  how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art ?  why don't they let him succumb in piece ? 
0	in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life .  the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small ,  and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings .  that said ,   " casanova "  left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski :     " casanova died too ,  just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all .  to say that he lived well is true ;  to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true .  the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find ;  that is why the human race stands where it does today :  we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas ,  all hollow inside ,  like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children .  "    as far as i could make it out ,  this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject ;  granted ,  with more empathy ,  but disgusted nonetheless .   casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior ,  themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in  " satyricon "  .  the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn ,  just without the coherence ;  and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction .   yet ,  there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool .  and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious ;  fellini couldn't .  more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro ,  for sure ,  but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else .  i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film .  it was a story not worth telling . 
0	this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california .  she thought it was wonderful because it was so real ,   " just the way people in the ohio valley are !  "  i'm from the area and i experienced the film as  " just the way people in california think we are !  "  i've lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there .  we laughed a lot ,  we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age ;  the young people went out together at night .  the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families .  the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else .   aside from the  " if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed "  condescension ,  the story lacked any elements of charm ,  mystery or even a sense of dread .   martha's character was the worst drawn .  it's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church ,  but if she had ,  she probably would have made friends there .  i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was  " younger ,  prettier and thinner "  but if this is the case it isn't shown .  all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender .  we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions ,  left out of the loop when social plans are made ,  used but not appreciated ,  and finally disrespected and hurt .   just one more thing :  are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks ?  please .  this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level . 
1	this film is fun ,  if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then .  by no means is this movie fine cinema ,  but if you dont take things too seriously ,  and can laugh at yourself once in a while ,  elvira is a good frownbuster . 
0	yet another  " son who won't grow up "  flick ,  and just the other recent like entries .  heder in another bad wig ,  channeling napoleon for ,  what ,  the third time ?  anna faris is forgettable ,  as always ;  jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state ,  at least ;  and diane keaton .  .  . how does one become typecast this late in a career ?  do not bother .  nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over .  i will say this ;  it's about a hundred times better than  " failure to launch "  .  there are very few amusing bits in the movie ,  unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny .  ha ,  ha !  he's old and he dropped the f-bomb !  tee ,  hee ,  hee .  pitiful ! 
1	felix unger  ( jack lemmon )  has just been dumped by his wife ,  because he is one of the most annoying  ,  neurotic people in the world .  suicide is his way out ,  but he just can't seem to get it to work ,  so he heads over to his friends house .  oscar madison  ( walther matthau )  is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven .  smoking ,  gambling ,  hitting on chicks ,  eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him .  well ,  with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in .  at first ,  it is a match made in heaven ,  felix cooks and cleans and helps oscar pay his alimony on time ,  but soon oscar is jonesing for women and felix  ( who in today's world would probably be gay )  isn't ready to move on .  they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are weeping and chatting about his family life ,  leaving oscar denied .  this is it ,  he explodes and throws him out ,  but felix isn't as helpless as it seems ,  and soon he has the upper hand .  my favorite quote  " you leave me little notes on my pillow .  told you 158 times i can't stand little notes on my pillow .   " we're all out of cornflakes .  f . u .  "  took me three hours to figure out f . u .  was felix ungar !  "  based on a neil simon play  ( who also wrote the screenplay )  ,  this has a certain theatre feel to it .  set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like  ( for better or worse )  .  lemmon and mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the grumpier old men movies and out to sea ,  reprising the same finicky/slob roles ,  but with different names  ( to avoid royalty issues ,  i'm sure )  .   this movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate .  the chocolate is smooth ,  sweet and rich ,  the strawberry is tart ,  juicy and bright red  ( unless you get those nasty greenish ones )  .  they are almost polar opposites ,  but together ,  the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert .  7/10   http : //blog . myspace . com/locoformovies
0	i hate to throw out lines like this ,  but in this case i feel like i have to :  the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years .  there ,  i said it .  and now that i have gotten that out of my system ,  please let me explain why .    " when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage ,  a curse is born .  the curse gathers in that place of death .  those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury .  "  that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing .  unfortunately ,  the filmmakers take it no further .  those who encounter the  " curse "  are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get .  you want more ?  well too bad .  some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you .  the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of ,  creepy images and sounds can only go so far .  director takashi shimizu ,  pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film ( s )  ,  valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over .  it pretty much unfolds like this :   -person walks into house  -something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard   -person goes to investigate  -sound starts to get loud  -person sees a ghost  -loud scream and/or cat screech  -cut to black  before the audience is even given a hint of plot ,  this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour .  the first time was actually somewhat creepy .  each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on .  by the time the end of the film rolled around ,  my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end  " with a loud scream and a cut to black .  "  we were never proved wrong .   the film has no liner storyline ,  instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled .  i have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right .  the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason .  i haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander 2 .  and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had .  if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death ,  how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic ?  and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone ?   obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made $15 million its first weekend ,  the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie .  the scariest things about the grudge are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the  " scariest movie ever made .  "  i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge ? 
1	i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred ,  went ahead and started watching .  i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex ,  involved and full of detail .  that is a good thing but also ,  quite unexpected in this culture of car chases ,  explosions ,  gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development .  in fact ,  what a welcome departure ,  however ,  i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch .    this film is chock full of character development and plot line ;  the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school .  it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer .  what a nice change .  i would compare it to 'all the president's men' in terms of generic subject matter .  that is ,  it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them .    unlike 'all the president's men' ,  this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality .  in this sense the movie is a character study like 'the negotiatior' with samuel jackson and kevin spacey .  in that movie ,  their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense .  yet ,  the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other ,  trust each ,  and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department .  there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically ,  there are many similarities .    i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration .  in fact ,  i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i've seen in my life going back to watergate .  the thing is ,  the public knows that something is wrong ,  for sure !  but following the details is hard to do .  this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity .  i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film :  unrealistic expectations .   if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience ,  it really is excellent !  i watched it 3 times in a row !  the acting is superb and the directing is flawless .  the weakest link is john cusak's accent . 
0	mulva is put in a sugercoma by teen ape .  when she awakens she's considerably hotter  ( the parts played by debbie rochon in this sequel )  ,  and out for revenge on those that did her wrong .  as the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the  " kill bill "  films ,  but this being a chris seaver's film ,  it's a wildly incompetent satire  ( and i use that last term extremely loosely )  i'd love to say this is better than the first film ,  but truth be told i was so impossibly drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time .  but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel  ( see when i'm drunk i like ,  for lack of a better word ,  complete and total crappy movies )  there are a few laugh out loud moments  ( very few )  but i do remember bonejack being funnier though .  well at least at slightly over an hour ,  it is over mighty quickly for what it's worth .   my grade :  d+   dvd extras :  audio commentary by director chris seaver ,  actress debbie rochon ,  and the lbp gang ;  second commentary by seaver ;  31 minute making of featurette ;  lloyd kaufman's 6 minute tribute to low budget pictures ;  fake 2 minute syrup commercial ;  stills gallery ;  promo trailer ;  and trailers for  : mulva "  ,  'quest for the egg salad "  ,   " fiilthy mcnasty " 1 ,  2 ,  & 3 ;   " the feral man "  ,   " the bonesetter "  ,   " midnight skater "  ,   " demon summer "  &  " splatter rampage wrestling " 
1	i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdam .   'xizhao' or 'shower' is a $200 . 000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons .  the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local ,  mostly aged men ,  come to relax and to go bathing .  the father has to sons :  a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him .  to this son the traditional village ,  the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying ,  but this changes along the movie .   though the story may sound cheesy or cliche ,  it's not .  with really great performances ,  especially of the father and the 'retarded' son  ( sorry ,  i don't know their names )  and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time .   if you got a chance to see this movie do it .  it's a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema .   
1	i´m from germany and i love the mvovies .  i go 200 times a year .  tonight i saw  " pecker "  ,  it was a wonderful evening .  thank you ,  mr .  waters .  everybody who has a chance to see the movie ,  go !  !  ! 
1	this is a good movie ,  a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do .  if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book ,  you will be very very disappointed .  i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school .   this is about a new kid in town named billy .  he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets .  billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins .   the acting is ok ,  probably the worst part of the movie .  the kid actors over exaggerate on many things .  they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms .  hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job ,  though .   the plot line is good as a movie ,  but it sucks as a book adaptation .  i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time .  .  .  . sometimes .   overall ,  this was a good family movie with some weak points .  i rate this movie 7/10 . 
0	this movie was bad beyond belief .  i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival .  before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before ,  which happened to be its  " world premiere .  "  i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point .  we all understood by the end .    its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one .  dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige ,  in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies .  the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least .  a scene would start going then someone would say  " wow you're so great bettie ,  why don't we make another movie .  "  this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as  ( and even more boring than )  the normal part of the movie .  by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up .  it was that ludicrous .  i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre ,  but people were not laughing with the movie maker ,  they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure .  this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory .    i know movies are expensive .  i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen .  the movie looks like it was made for $12 .  the cuts ,  the graininess ,  and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience .  this movie makes  " dude ,  where's my car ?  "  look like citizen kane .    my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured .  the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good .  apparently ,  the previous night ,  the night of the  " world premiere "  the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie .  bettie paige's movies were destroyed .  they should destroy this movie too . 
0	elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community .  and while it was a very interesting idea in concept ,  in reality it has failed miserably .   the film is beautifully rendered ,  which is probably the only redeeming factor .  a huge problem with them ,  however ,  is the vast overruse of light bloom .  it's horrible ,  although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality .   one thing to note is the terrible voice acting .  while proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent ,  emo's voice actor is horrible .  i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero ,  you can't afford to hire real voice actors .  to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice .   as a whole ,  the movie doesn't really go anywhere .  to me it seems like it's more of a  " look what we can do "  kind of movie instead of a real film .  the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point .  the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas .   overall ,  it may be worth a quick download from the official site ,  but don't expect anything except pretty graphics . 
1	yes ,  keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film .  with a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits ,  he'll remind you of jimmy cagney !  johnny  ( keaton )  is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high-priced medical bills & to send his younger brother  ( griffin dunne )  to law school .  no one even knows johnny kelly is johnny dangerously until later on in the film .  joe piscopo is vermin & doesn't like johnny one bit  ( & i don't like vermin )  .  marilu henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while johnny revels in it .  i love the part when they're in the ever-changing getaway car !  the cop who's  " calling all cars "  is the skipper from gilligan's island !  see this one for 1930's gangster laughs !  the gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them !  look in the background of every scene . 
0	i don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail .  sylvester stallone is once again john rambo ,  author and survivor of  " a season in hell "  ,  recruited from prison by his only friend ,  major richard crenna ,  to secretly return to vietnam ,  take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps ,  and return without engaging the enemy .   fat chance .  what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in ,  take pics ,  and sneak out ?  who would come to see the movie ?    it's essentially a celebration of stallone's muscles .  preparing for his mission ,  we see his well-oiled muscles bulging .   ( they are oiled and bulging throughout .  )  there is the ritual strapping on of black leather ,  ugly guns ,  and even uglier knives .  the black guns are cleaned ,  assembled with loud clacks ,  and almost as oiled as stallone's muscles .  the bow is tested and ,  yes ,  it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy's forehead .  the knife is sharpened with slick snicks .   stallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington ,  cynical politicians who ,  you can bet ,  were never even in a fist fight in grammar school .  no guts ,  you know ?  just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer .   the movie does what it set out to do ,  but what it set out to do is meretricious .  it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese .  the bumper stickers were ubiquitous .   ( free our mias .  )  why would they keep them ?  it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor .  or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states -- a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the world .   as a captive ,  rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese .  dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists ,  his muscles still on display .  then ,  not content with subhuman vietnamese ,  a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer --  " vee haff vays of making you remember .  "  a high-tech type ,  the russian uses psychology and electricity ,  not just pig dump .   rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until  " this country loves us as much as we love it ,  "  bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed ,  which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions .  the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group .  at least rambo's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel ,  which arrived apace .   the action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless .  it marches dully through it's phantasmal ideological swamp ,  killing without mercy ,  barely speaking ,  barely able to speak .  to speak is a sign of weakness . 
1	i loved the movie ,  but like everyone said ,  there were some bits that weren't developed enough .  i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison ;  sure ,  they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still .  .  . i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have .  for example ,  in the montage where they're sight-seeing ,  the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking .   then ,  there are some parts that were very ambiguous .  i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it ,  but i can see how that could be confusing .  also ,  why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk ?  i thought it was suggesting something ,  but it turned out to be nothing .   apart from that ,  the movie was great .  i cried when claire danes took the blame ;  she's a great actress .   also ,  i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked .  talk about lack of closure .  .  . 
0	i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family .  this movie could have been so much more .  the trouble ?  it was set during the big action movie craze .  i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing .  i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause .  yes it had funny scenes  ( or laughable )  though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes .  if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge .   i give this movie a low number .  it may not have been this low if i had not read the book . 
1	moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family !   before the real story of the movie starts ,  we get a performance of the bad tour  ( man in the mirror )  ,  and it kicks off a great movie .  after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier ,  as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 .  after a few music videos also  ( speed demon ,  leave me alone ,  etc .  )  the story starts .   the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends  ( who are kids )  are being chased by the bad guy of the story  " mr .  big "  ,  because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs .  during the chase we see fantastic segments ,  fx .  michaels video for smooth criminal ,  which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences ,  etc .  but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr .  big ,  and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict .   during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards ,  but also impressive today .  for instance ,  see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends !  it's so cool !   the movie ends with a performance of come together  ( later published in michaels double-album of history )  ,  and you leave the movie with a magic feeling .  amazing !   i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv .  and now some parents might stand up and say :   " but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser !  "  yeah ,  he is indeed ,  but ,  come on ,  we all know it isn't true !  wait and see .  . 
1	the film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  ( u . s .  )  .  we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film .  befittingly ,  the obvious of student v . s .  teacher is present .  but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships :  male v . s .  female ,  white v . s .  black ,  and the individual v . s .  society .  but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s .  himself .    i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus .  most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other .  this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides .  it did not attempt to show how either was right ,  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  ( quite obvious towards the end )  .  the film also discusses sex and rape .  it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together ,  for a time .  lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps .  he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive .  other stars that make this film are omar epps ,  ice cube ,  and jennifer connelly .  michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance .  tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper .  in fact ,  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other ,  rather than some dry book ,  as the real education at a university .  it is a life-learning process ,  not a textual one .  i think you'll find  " higher learning "  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .  8/10
0	i really don't understand all these positive user reviews .  this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic .   eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film .  but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors .  he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial ;  their acting ,  the idea ,  the make-up ,  everything .   the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie ,  which was very bad executed .   don't watch this bullshit ,  go watch a fellini ,  woody allen or some david lynch . 
0	my one line summary should explain it all ,  but i'll have a go at it .   from the get-go ,  this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera ,  and that's about all i can comment on .  there were a few interesting scenes ,  such as the  " big one "  that hit during the middle of the movie ,  but ,  wait ,  what's that ?  the earthquake *gasp* ,  wait a minute !  that's dante's peak !  well ,  parts of it butchered and slapped in .  i can't believe how poorly this movie was done ,   " borrowing "  scenes from other ,  much better films .  one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown la ,  ala dante's peak .   my advise ,  forget the bond wanna-be ,  nash ,  in this film and go for the real thing  ( again ,  someone from dante's peak coincidentally .  )   
1	fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool .  i haven't seen the earlier film ,  and i don't know if that's a good thing or not .  i can only regard the current film on its own merits .   for most people ,  hal hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like or you don't .  his combination of action ,  drama ,  absurdity and dry ,  ironic humour really resonates with me ,  and fay grim is no exception .  it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud .  for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness .  it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes .   during the second half of the film ,  the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller .  whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear ,  but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum .   the performances were generally good ,  particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum ,  who had the most screen time .  saffron burrows ,  james urbaniak ,  carl montgomery and elina löwensohn all played good support roles .  the film's visuals were nice  ( set in new york ,  paris ,  berlin and istanbul )  and the music  ( also by hartley )  was good without being intrusive .  the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely .  if you like hartley's earlier work ,  you'll probably like this . 
1	first of all ,  i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan .  i think it's the greatest horror series ever .  for me ,  freddy is the boogeyman !  of course ,  freddy's dead ,  which tried to be the last chapter back then ,  is a weird movie .  it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films .  freddy has a lot of screen time .  some think it makes him less scary ,  which i do agree .  and that's ,  in my opinion ,  exactly the point .  this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better ,  who he is ,  who he were ,  how he became the man haunting our dreams .  for some people ,  it's a bad thing ,  it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil .  obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween .  to truly enjoy this one ,  you have to see things differently .  it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you .  this was the first one ,  and it was awesome .  as the years passed by ,  freddy killed more and more people ,  and nobody could ever get rid of him for good .  now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil ,  the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror .  beside the story of freddy's past ,  i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie .  no more kids in springwood ,  only crazy grown-ups .  the nightmare scenes are all great .  the soundtrack is awesome ,  especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls .  in my opinion ,  the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated .  maybe it is misunderstood ,  or i have different tastes !  anyway ,  all freddy fans should watch it .  it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too ,  and a lot of cameos !  get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed . 
0	we rented five movies for new year's eve weekend and watched this one first .  all i can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one .  it was pointless and vulgar .  harvey keitel's script must have been easy to write -- just make two out every three words a curse word .  andie mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll ,  but the movie has nothing else to recommend it . 
1	i've loved this movie ever since it first came out .  i was about nine years old ,  and now i'm 27 .  i remember playing the video game on sega genisis .  i had so much fun ,  i would love to show my son this movie .  he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid .  even though he's much younger than i was when i first saw it .  i can't wait for it to come out on dvd !  i hope it comes out on dvd !  please let it come out on dvd !  !  i'm dying to see it again !  !  !  well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again .  i love all of the videos in this movie .  my favorite mini-video is badder ! 
1	thank god abc picked this up instead of fox .  the best description  ( for those in the know )  is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way possible .   i'm not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions .  i also enjoy checkered floors ,  pies ,  talking toys ,  gravelings and other mischievous items  :  )  while a bit  " burtonesque "  ,  i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesn't require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground .  here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest ! 
0	its christmas eve and lazy and submissive housewife della  ( kim basinger )  receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband .  leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall .  its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible ,  della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces ,  she leaves them a note saying as much .  returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs ,  yup the owners of the car she left a note on ,  they are very angry and want some fun with her ,  a kindly security guard steps into assist her ,  but things get out of hand and the guard is shot ,  della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit ,  they shoot at her ,  she looses control of her car and crashes ,  quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk ,  she hides in a deserted building site ,  but is soon caught ,  just before they try to rape and kill her ,  from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench ,  wounding their leader  " chuckie "  ,  she manages to escape again into the nearby woods ,  in the fracas one of the gang is killed ,  it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues .  a similar plot line to eden lake drew me to this ,  but that is where the comparisons end .  this is a brainless and dumb film ,  shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved ,  the doe eyed disney-esquire twin kids are horrible to watch ,  but its lukas haas as chuckie ,  that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department ,  although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband .  as a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through ,  even in the set up early on della's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its christmas eve ,  now where could they be going with this i wonder ?  ?  ?  the only surprising part of this $hit is when after killing all the clichéd bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox ,  she demands chuckie to f@ck her ,  if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness ,  it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor .  even the ending is messed up ,  all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed .  .  i didn't think i could be further disappointed ,  but then i saw that guillermo del toro produced this dreck
0	i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters ,  but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap .  if you look at promotional pictures/posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime .  this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap .  when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar .  i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have .  i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over .   as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill ,  most of the great characters are gone now  ( although a few still remain i think )  and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't ,  its just that they lack the tough looks ,  personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble .   overall being one of the only police programs on television these days ,  the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch ,  but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness  ( if thats the right spelling )  and would now be classed as a terrible ,  unreal television soap .   recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
0	this movie tries hard ,  but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series ,  that i am sure people do remember with fondness .  although i am 17 ,  i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun .  sadly ,  this movie does little justice to the series .   the special effects are rather substandard ,  and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work .  the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour .  other films with under-par scripting are home alone 4 ,  cat in the hat ,  thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion .   now i will say i liked the idea of the story ,  but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early ,  and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy .  and i was annoyed by the talking suit ,  despite spirited voice work from wayne knight .   but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd ,  jeff daniels and daryl hannah ,  all very talented actors .  jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before ,  but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing ,  and elizabeth hurley's character sadly came across as useless .  daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored ,  and i liked the idea of her being the love interest ,  but sadly you see very little of her ,  ( not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them )  likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative .  christopher lloyd acquits himself better ,  and as an actor i like lloyd a lot ( he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit ,  and i am fond of back to the future )  but he was given little to work with ,  and had a tendency to overact quite wildly .   overall ,  as much i wanted to like this movie ,  i was left unimpressed .  instead of being fun ,  it came across as pointless ,  and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential ,  with some talented actors and a good idea ,  but wasted with poor execution .  1/10 bethany cox
1	hollow point ,  though clumsy in places ,  manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie .   the primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy .   oh ,  by the way ,  advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie .  .  . 
0	boy oh boy oh golly gee ,   the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom's  " invisibility .  "  they looked like they were shot on cheap video ,  and it looks totally unreal ,  and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie .  .  .   i did not end up loving this movie .  the attempted  " steadicam "  shots were really pathetic as well .  i mean ,  hey ,  if they had a low budget flick ,  that's fine .  you can still make a great movie with a low budget .  but ,  a bad movie and a low budget and effects .  that makes for a bad combination .  in this case ,  such a doomed combo created the craptastic film ,   " invisible mom .  "  if you have kids ,  and your kids have no taste ,  perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one . 
1	i loved this movie !  i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan ,  but i really enjoyed myself .  the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going !  this is a bit of a departure for disney ,  they don't spend quite as much time on character development  ( my husband pointed this out ) and there are no musical numbers .  it is strictly action adventure .  i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney ,  be they young or old . 
1	antonio margheriti's  " danza macabra "  aka .   " castle of blood "  of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror ,  and after mario bava's  " la maschera del demonio "   ( aka .   " black sunday "  )  of 1960 and roger corman's  " pit and the pendulum "  of 1961  ( starring the great vincent price )  another must-see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures .  but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all-time ,  the screenplay to  " danza macabra "  was co-written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci ,  who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as  " django "   ( 1966 )  and  " the great silence "   ( 1968 )  .  italy's number 2 in the field  ( right after mario bava )  ,  director antonio margheriti is one of the all-time masters of gothic horror ,  and  " castle of blood "  is doubtlessly his greatest achievement .  hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting ,  yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece .    when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories ,  edgar allen poe ,  in a gloomy london tavern ,  young journalist alan foster  ( georges rivière )  accepts a bet from a nobleman ,  that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls' eve .  as soon as foster enters the eerie castle ,  mysterious things start to happen .  after a little while ,  however ,  he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle ,  the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood  ( barbara steele )  .  the mysterious events so far ,  however ,  have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears ,  however .  .  .   the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood ,  the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison .  the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always ,  i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress .  no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele ,  and no actress ever will .  besides steele ,  the movie's cast contains another stunning beauty ,  margarete robsahm ,  and she also delivers a great performance .  george rivière's performance as alan foster is great ,  and the rest of the performances are also very good .   " castle of blood "  is outstanding in many departments :  barbara steele delivers one of her best performances ,  the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison ,  the atmosphere is incredibly eerie .  .  .  the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere ,  gothic beauty and the art of terror .  in short :   " castle of blood "  is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made ,  and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre !  10/10
1	i love this movie ,  but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid .   the fateful game took place in 1972 .  that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 .  but almost all of the music played at the dances etc .  is from the 1950s and very early 1960s .   having just attended my 30th high school reunion ,  i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music .   i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically .  but it wasn't completely bereft ,  and the producers of the film should have taken more care .  i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film .   this was a bad director and/or producer decision . 
0	i had very low expectations for this alleged  " re-imagining "  of the original -- and they weren't even met !  what were they thinking ?   ( answer :  they weren't .  )  please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest .  clip your nails ,  balance your checkbook ,  do anything besides watch this .  remember :  if you rent stuff like this ,  it will only ensure they make more . 
1	this movie is ok if you like mindless action  , corny acting ,  and a very small plot  ! the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of " event horizon "  .  the costumes are like something from a mad max movie  . none of the soldiers talk  , so others tell them what to do . it eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place .  i personally liked russell better in  " tango and cash "  " escape from la/new york "  and  " executive decision "  .  it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie !  ! 
0	is rich ,  ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean ,  or is she just overreacting--or more precisely ,  overacting--as usual ?  actually ,  both are applicable in director joseph losey's wandering ,  meandering mess called  " boom "  ,  appropriately titled since tempers in the lush ,  luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode .  richard burton climbs taylor's mountain uninvited ;  she dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber .  though great-looking in widescreen ,  the picture is otherwise quite deadly ,  a failure even liz 'n dick-philes should shun  ( the stars' collective  " what the hell !  "  attitude to their late-'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here )  .  pointless ,  confused ,  and maddening ,   " boom "  is a catastrophe--although screenwriter tennessee williams ,  who adapted his own unsuccessful play  " the milk train doesn't stop here anymore "  ,  was said to be quite fond of it !  * from ****
1	the penultimate episode of star trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season .  essentially ,  spock ,  mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr .  atoz ,  the librarian .  all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon's past .  spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'city on the edge of forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon's present .  in the end ,  all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova .  the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes .   ironically ,  as william shatner notes in his book  " star trek memories ,  "  this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way .  nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer ,  fred freiberger ,  that vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love .   ( p . 272 )  however ,  freiberger reasoned ,  the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state .  this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode .  while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in  " plato's stepchildren ,  "  play music with hippies in  " the way to eden "  or sometimes display emotion ,  the script here was more believable .  spock's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner .   ( p . 272 )  the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time ,  mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state ,  not just spock .  but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows ,  the brilliant spock/mccoy performance and the originality of this script .  who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past ?  this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek'--a genuinely inspired story .    shatner ,  in 'memories' ,  named some of his best  " unusual and high quality shows "  of season 3 as the enterprise incident ,  day of the dove ,  is there in truth no beauty ,  the tholian web ,  and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome .   ( p . 273 )  while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty' is problematic ,   " all our yesterdays "  certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films .  i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays . '

0	i can find very little thats good to say about this film .  i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people .  i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography .  michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor ,  and at no time no did i actually believe in his character .  the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son .  some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films ,  that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller .  the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars ,  wondering why i bothered to watch it at all . 
1	my name is domino harvery .  {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey .  {cut ,  chop} my name is domino harvey .  {edit .  cut .  playback}  never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before .  by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy ,  flashy ,  dizzying editing technique .  if i have to choose between loving it and hating it ,  i'd say i love it .  it was borderline distracting at times ,  but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality  ( even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos )  .   this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy .  otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her ,  no matter how much she suffered .  we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke ,  rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez .  the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company  ( what is christopher walken doing in every film ,  by the way ?  )  .  i guess that is a clever film technique ,  because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes .  it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point .   it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace ,  with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence .  there are some funny jokes ;  it's all very modern and surreal at the same time .  it's a mess ,  but it's a rather enjoyable mess .  it is ultimately flawed in so many ways  ( the actors try too hard to make their characters  " cool "  ,  for one )  but it works .  i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well .   7 out of 10
1	saturday june 3 ,  6 : 30pm the neptune  monday june 5 ,  4 : 30pm the neptune  few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura's brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz' masterpiece iberia suite .  at the approach of its centennial ,  saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland .  the twelve  " impressions "  of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings ,  allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura's camera .  creative use of large flats and mirrors ,  moved throughout the set ,  combined with screens ,  shadows ,  fire ,  rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song ,  dance and instrumental performance .  photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program ,  connecting the passion of the music to its great creator .  saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors . 
1	jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands ,  trying to make sense of what he's just done .  meanwhile ,  a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen .  an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot ,  but as he speaks ,  it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory ,  as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security .   this shot effectively captures the mood of the film .  as well as portraying bourne's quest to find out how he became jason bourne ,  ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security .   it is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year .    it's just so intense .  bourne says to simon ross  ( considine )   " this isn't some newspaper story ,  this is real "  and in the audience you almost believe him .  the camera shakes ,  but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers ,  and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying ,  instead of just being actors performing well-written roles .  the action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement ;  the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing .   the pacing is just incredible .  it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion ,  but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot ;  the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece .  while they're often simple  ( the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone )  they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them .  the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it .   with its intense action set-pieces ,  brilliantly paced storyline ,  and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security ,  the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age .  ultimatum is its peak . 
1	i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said ,  but this is one of the best series ever !  it was a great shame when it was canceled ,  and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again .  the good news is that it is out on dvd !  !  !  !  i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it .  gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character ,  and all actors were very good .  it is a shame that the network did not continue it .  shaun cassidy ,  this is a masterpiece .  anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it ,  must do so .  you will not be disappointed .  my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television  ( she is 20 )  is becoming very interested ,  and will soon be a fan .  she finds it  " very twisted "  and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen .  i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired .   this show rocks !  !  !  ! 
1	comment ?  like my comment is necessary ?  we are talking about all time masterpiece ,  for all seasons and all generations .  this is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch .  in this ,  like in other disney's movies is some kind of magic .  all characters are in some way ,   " alive "  and  " real "  so it's easy to understand message ,  even if you don't understand language ,   ( like i didn't understood when i first watched movie ,  because i was about six years old )  .  maybe my english is not so good ,  but i learned what i know mostly from this kind of movies ,  and this is one more great dimension of this kind of movies ,  which in present time are rare .  but there is a one big shame .  in my country is now impossible to watch this ,  or any other disney's movie !  we don't have copyrights ,  so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movies .  so ,  we will watch this movie again  " once upon a dream "  or .  .  .  ? 
0	or anyone who was praying for the sight of al cliver wrestling a naked ,  7ft tall black guy into a full nelson ,  your film has arrived !  film starlet laura crawford  ( ursula buchfellner )  is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway .  what they don't count on is rugged vietnam vet peter weston  ( cliver )  being hired by a film producer to save the girl .  and what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes .   pretty much the same filming set up as cannibals ,  this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value ,  thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes  ( franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview )  .  franco gets a strong eurocult supporting cast including gisela hahn  ( contamination )  and werner pochath  ( whose death is one of the most head-scratching things i ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him )  .  the film features tons of nudity and the gore  ( tempra paint variety )  is there .  the highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between cliver and antonio de cabo in the splashing waves .  sadly ,  ol' jess pads this one out to an astonishing  ( and ,  at times ,  agonizing )  1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops .    for the most part ,  the severin dvd looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes .  also ,  one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs  ( they are an option ,  but only when you listen to the french track )  .  franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about buchfellner than his cannibals star sabrina siani . 
1	even though ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitler's life and yes ,  this is dramatised ,  but essential .  robert carlyle plays hitler during his later years ,  during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany ,  including the night of the long knives .  this tv-film  ( also a two-part mini-series )  shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power ,  e . g .  the financial disaster of 1930 .   the series follows hitler and little else ,  apart from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl .  all in all ,  valuable and filled with interesting actors ,  yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography ;  most actors are portrayed in half-body shots which  ( for me )  makes for a theatrical stance ,  not cinematic .  the tempo is at times drowsy ,  and the film does suffer from it ,  being approximately 2 , 5 hours long . 
0	the fifth  " black emanuelle "  i've watched has ,  potentially ,  the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown ,  new york !  the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which ,  inexplicably ,  play completely different roles ,  namely ivan rassimov  ( appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries !  )  ,  karin shubert  ( as a feminist rival reporter )  and don powell  ( as rassimov's chauffeur )  .   unfortunately ,  as usual with this type of film  ( despite their being shown in the dead of night )  ,  it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene  ( described in  " stracultr )  in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here !  !  still ,  a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls  ( including ,  naturally ,  gemser and shubert )  into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums  ( this is the way he gets their votes ,  get it !  )  - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact .   the most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from gemser's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house  ( even in front of perfect strangers )  - is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan/guru  ( george eastman made up to look considerably christ-like !  )  who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely ;  of course ,  when emanuelle calls him up on it ,  he ends up having premature ejaculation .  .  .  !  ! 
1	once when i was in college and we had an international fair ,  the russian section had a soviet-era poster saying  " ne boltay !  "  ,  meaning  " don't gossip !  "  .  i  " translated "  it for the  " generation "  of tv watchers as  " don't be gladys kravitz !  "   ( in reference to the nosy neighbor on  " bewitched "  )  .   however ,  when you see the result of gossip in the pvt .  snafu short  " rumors "  ,  you see that it's not quite a laughing matter .  in this case ,  the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states .  so ,  he tells it to someone ,  who tells someone else ,  who tells someone else ,  and it continues .  as in  " the russians are coming ,  the russians are coming "  ,  the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time ,  so that when it gets back to snafu .  .  . well ,  you know what i mean !  yes ,  it's mostly wwii propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the japanese - but i have to say that the pvt .  snafu shorts were actually quite funny .  of course ,  since they had dr .  seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices ,  it's no surprise that these came out rather cool .  worth seeing . 
0	warning spoilers following .  superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place .  other than that ,  libelous !  ,  scandalous !  filmed in canada ;  presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast .  i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada .  nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is ;  and starring susan sarandon of all people !  i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary ;  kenn borek air . 
0	it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all .  it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen .   not only have i ever been this bored before  ( luckily not for more then 1 , 5 hours )  ,  the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted .  after the first very awkward part ,  you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better .  you hope in vain ,  it only goes downhill from there .   the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times .  one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again .  .  . 
0	this is the worst movie i have ever seen .  i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it .  now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role .  i was physically ill after watching this film .  i really don't understand hollywood sometimes .  there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best .  that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge .  the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film .  glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv .  this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost . 
1	i rented domino on a whim ,  not even knowing it was inspired by a true story ,  and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see .  i found it to be rather awesome .   with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment .  and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it .    domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career .  it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott .  and with fast paced music and editing ,  it provides the visual flare to keep your attention ,  with slick performances and unexpected comedy ,  the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience .    i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours . 
1	if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot ,  then this film is not for you .  nope--you'll hate it .  however ,  for those who like sweet ,  slightly screwball comedies ,  then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film .   tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return .  however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit ,  everyone in the family is thrilled to have company .  they dote on him and treat him like one of the family ,  .  .  . and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter ,  debbie reynolds .  that's really about all the plot there is .  but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting .  a really nice little curio from the late 1950s . 
1	this movie probably would only get a 7 or 8 from me to tell the truth if i had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about .  since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong 9 from me .   i read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it .  it was good advice .  read the rest at your own risk of spoiling .   eva mendez plays a head-strong ,  success-starved network tv programmer that took a joke made by a co-worker while brain-storming tv program ideas about russian roulette seriously .  the story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen . 
1	although the plot was a bit sappy at times ,  and very rushed at the end ,  as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story ,  overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre .    however ,  the actress who played the babysitter ,  mariana klaveno ,  was very good !  i hope to see more of her around in movie-land .  the music was also well done ,  getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh  ( think  " jaws "  )  type music-based tension build-ups .   i don't think i'd want to watch  " while the children sleep "  again ,  but if i did ,  it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno . 
0	this movie is possibly the cheapest ,  cheesiest ,  and poorest sequel ever made .   yet ,  it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney ,  and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish .   it's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions .   *spoiler alert* the first one's all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument .  then ,  three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to belle .  part way through this little episode ,  belle has wall eyes ,  which made my siblings and i laugh so hard .  then ,  she and the beast fight more over the letter .  .  .  and later learn the meaning of forgiveness .  how old are they ?  ?  ?  certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness .   then ,  the next one's all about lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance .  this coming from the man who could woo anything female .  and they make fifi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill belle ,  and winds up getting off scotch-free by the end of it .  what a message to send the kids !   then ,  the next one's all about mrs .  potts being angsty .  and the next one after that's all about beast becoming overly possessive of a bird ,  to the point where he just seems downright silly .   the animation's so ugly ,  it kills .  there are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see .  .  .  and the coloring is awful .   belle's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong .  plus ,  she's petty and very different from the usual belle .   and the side characters are annoying .  .  .   ( i mean ,  cogsworth and lumiere fight almost all the time .  i know they did that in the movie ,  but it was overdone in this .  )   but the worst character is mrs .  potts .  she's ruined in this .  i can't even describe it .  just buy it and see for yourself .   i give it a 1/10 for the sap ,  but i give it a 10/10 for comedy . 
1	this is a very funny movie !  i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not .  however ,  i do think men all over the world can identify with  " frank "  and his thoughts to some extent !  these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm sure !   all cast members perform well ,  and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us .  but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish ,  you are in for a treat !   highly recommended . 
0	a spoiler .   what three words can guarantee you a terrible film ?  cheap canadian production .  the brain fits those words perfectly .  terrible script ,  idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every bad movie fan .  the horror is hilarious .  the post production team looks like it gave up .  what makes the brain admirable is in the second half ,  it actually tries to be good !  can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke ?   it's around christmas time .  a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever .  the day later ,  a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis .   if a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it ,  who would you believe ?  what begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when the brain tries to be serious .  a child cannot be frightened by the scary moments .  the brain is too funny a concept to try and be gritty .  the psychological research institute is larger than major manufacturing plants !  our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting i have seen .  viewer discretion advised heavily . 
1	i absolutely loved this show .  i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode .  in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days .  definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children .  yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books ,  but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons .  the actress that portrays jo bhaer  ( michelle burke )  does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley  ( spencer rochfort )  throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn .  i recommend this show to anyone . 
1	cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams .  it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations ,  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .   there are many great laughs  ( even if the story is somewhat thin )  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style .  a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses ,  which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience .  as he makes his exit ,  he assures the client  ( grant )  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100 . 00 from the total .  .  . or at least $50 . 00 .  .  . but certainly $25 . 00 .  hilarious ! 
1	this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective ,  more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events ,  though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston ,  bowie ,  travis and crockett .   the focus here is on jim bowie ,  played with sharp ,  cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 .  then 65 ,  he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part .   puerto rican-born raul julia humanizes gen .  santa ana as no one since j .  carol naish back in '54 had done .  however ,  the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous ,  vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since .  he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but ,  convinced of his own infallibility ,  he does not heed it .   alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays :  col .  william travis .  his portrayal is earnest .  he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him .   the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett .  in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy ,  he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie .  with no conviction in the portrayal ,  the character is reduced to a few stage conventions .    the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions .  we learn that jim bowie was ,  in the person of santa ana ,  fighting his own brother-in-law .  the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier .   " santa ana likes a bargain .  "  bowie wryly explains .  the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film  " the alamo "  . 
0	this self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on mr .  branagh's career as an adapter of shakespeare for the cinema .   ( released 4 years ago ;  not a peep of an adaptation since .  )  i just finished watching this on cable -- holy god ,  it's terrible .   i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill .  that being said ,  i'll take the risk ,  if only because *love's labour's lost* is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr .  branagh's directorial abilities in the past .  branagh has always been a pretty lousy director :  grindingly literal-minded ;  star-struck ;  unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors  ( he loves his american stars ,  but loves himself more ,  making damn sure that he gets all the good lines )  .   along those lines ,  the sad fact remains that *love's labour's lost* is scarcely worse than the interminable ,  ghastly ,  bloated *hamlet* from 1996 .  in fact ,  this film may be preferable ,  if only because it's about 1/3 the length .  branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeare's to the milieu of cole porter ,  george gershwin ,  fred astaire ,  yada yada .  so he sets the thing in 1939 ,  leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of thirties' standards  ( wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during  " i'm in heaven "  )  ,  and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing  ( himself included )  .  the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didn't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies .  i don't even blame the cast .  to paraphrase hamlet ,   " the screenplay's the thing !  "  no one could possibly come off well in this hodge-podge :  the illustrious rsc alumni fare no better than alicia silverstone .  who could possibly act in this thing ?   branagh's first mistake was in thinking that *love's labour's lost* was a play worth filming .  trust me ,  it isn't .  it's an anomaly in the bard's canon ,  written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers -- not the usual audience for which he wrote .  hence ,  there's a lot of precious  ( and tedious !  )  word-play ,  references to contemporary scholastic nonsense ,  parodies of lyly's *euphues*  .   .   .  in other words ,  hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience .  hell ,  it doesn't appeal to an audience already predisposed to shakespearean comedy .  the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately  " updating "  it with any gimmick that comes to hand .  which begs the question ,  why bother ?   branagh's second mistake was in thinking that shakespeare's cream-pie of a play could be served with a side-order of gershwin's marmalade .  clearly the idea ,  or hope ,  was to make an unintelligible elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time .  but again ,  this begs the question ,  why bother ?   
1	the 1930s .  classy ,  elegant adele  ( marvelously played with dignified resolve by debbie reynolds )  and batty ,  frumpy helen  ( the magnificent shelley winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache )  are the mothers of two killers .  they leave their seamy pasts in the midwest behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets .  adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln palmer  ( the always fine dennis weaver )  .  on the other hand ,  religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness .   director curtis  (  " night tide ,  "   " ruby "  )  harrington ,  working from a crafty script by henry farrell  ( who wrote the book  " whatever happened to baby jane ?  "  was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for  " hush  .  .  .  hush ,  sweet charlotte "  )  ,  adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt ,  fear ,  repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok .  the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles :  michael macliammoir as a pompous elocution teacher ,  agnes moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist ,  yvette vickers as a snippy ,  overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star ,  logan ramsey as a snoopy detective ,  and timothy carey as a creepy bum .  an elaborate talent recital set piece with pamelyn ferdin  ( the voice of lucy in the  " peanuts "  tv cartoon specials )  serving as emcee and original  " friday the 13th "  victim robbi morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight .  david raskin's spooky score ,  a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant ,  the flavorsome depression-era period atmosphere ,  lucien ballard's handsome cinematography ,  and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective .  mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd doublebill with  " whoever slew auntie roo ?  ;  "  both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers . 
1	this is an ok adaptation ,  but not as good as the tv version .  the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley ,  particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version .  gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again ,  i preferred kate beckinsale's emma .  there are excellent support performances from toni collette ,  juliet stephenson and sophy thompson .   the script is often played too much for laughs ,  the book is a comedy ,  but there are too many set-piece gags here ,  and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent .   my biggest criticism is the scenery .  it is far too lush .  england has never been like this .  it looks like a chocolate box .  only americans would make it like this .   despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more . 
0	 " cut "  is a film about some film students making a film .  it's very much in the  " scream "  mold ,  an ironic ,  self-referential horror flick which ,  for me at least ,  falls down because for all its irony ,  it's still just a bad horror film ,  same as the films its referring to .   but it was not without its charms .  well ,  one charm anyway .  molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt ,  bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew .  she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act ,  although everyone involved with  " cut "  says she was lovely to work with .   : - )   seriously ,  every scene of her pouting ,  sulking or snapping was great .  everyone else ,  however ,  wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden .   anyway ,   " cut "  has some laughs ,  a few buckets of gore  ( some of it surprisingly gruesome )  ,  and ultimately is .  .  just another bad horror film . 
1	star trek :  hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film ,  done completely for the love of the series ,  and a must watch for fans of trek .  the production quality is extremely high for a fan film ,  although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it .  this doesn't take away from the overall experience however .  the cgi ships are fantastic ,  as well as the space battle scenes .  .  .  on the negative side ,  i could tell in the earlier episodes  ( and even occasionally in the newer ones )  that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles ,  but once again ,  this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek .  the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here ,  and ,  as a whole , i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9 . 
0	blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties .  the plot is completely pointless ;  its overtones of lonliness are pathetic .  do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film ,  like buying a mansion for a mere $300 grand .  the notion ,  let alone the bargain-basement price ,  will only be believed by the most gullible viewers .  please ,  respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful ,  awful film . 
0	for all of the hype about this film ,  i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think .  and ,  although a bit slow at times ,  the first 90% of the movie is quite good ,  with more than a few  " old time "  scares that make one jumpy and unsettled .  i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes .  where dark remains fails ,  however ,  is in its climax .  the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body .  the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and ,  the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma ?  - was not elucidated upon !  the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best ,  and in the end ,  i felt very cheated .  what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending . 
0	worst movie ever made !  !  !  please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie . check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film .  the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film .  i find the positive comments very misleading .  i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech .  don't waste your hard earned money !  !  !  !  !  !  this film is retarded !  !  i can't believe a film like this would ever be made .  why would hollywood waste their time on such junk ?  this film is an attempt at nothing .  i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash .  i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money .  i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash .  please don't make the same mistake !  it really is the  " worst movie ever made !  " 
0	i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out .  it was pretty horrible .  in the process of trying too hard ,  they over acted and made a horrible movie .  i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark--but ,  i was wrong .  i was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie .  i was lured in by the free aspect of the preview ,  but it turned out to be a waste of my time--and ,  usually ,  i'm very easily amused .  it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ,  ideas and filming ,  but because they threw together so many ideas at once ,  it failed .  i'm not usually picky about movies and i usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies ,  but i had to warn everyone not to watch it .  i registered on imdb just to tell all of you guys
0	if you are looking for eye candy ,  you may enjoy sky captain .  sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers .  the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie .  now ,  saying that ,  the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain .   after ten minutes ,  i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time .  i was hoping this movie would get better ,  but it never achieved any degree of interest .  after thirty minutes ,  the urge to walk out kept growing and growing .  now ,  i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number .  yet ,  this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life .   acting---there is none .  the three main performers are pitiful .  jude law  ( also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on )  is just awful in the title role .  i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again .   paltrow tries so hard to be campy ,  that it backfires in her face .  the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting .  after this performance ,  i would applaud that decision .   story---soap operas are better written .  the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses .   directing---none .  everything was put into the special effects that story ,  acting and directing suffer greatly .  even  " the phantom menace "  had better acting and that is not saying a great deal .   i would have to give this movie a  " 0 "  out of  " 10 "  .  avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release . 
1	i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes ,  dude ,  i was wrong .   " election "  is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama ,  taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals .  characters are constantly on the move ,  and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider ,  it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters .  furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts .  although there's hardly any action ,  the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality .  cool movie that deserves more attention ,  and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit . 
1	this is a very entertaining flick ,  considering the budget and its length .  the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty .  the acting was great  ( p'z to dom )  and the cinematography was also very well done .  i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers ,  it will not disappoint you ! 
0	michael williams ,  who works for bbc ,  finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art :  a documentary .  but since his wife's mysterious death her daughter ,  emily ,  has been emotionally disturbed ,  so he goes spoleto ,  where the problematic picture is ,  with her and her nanny ,  jill .  and there is a countess ,  who is also a psychic ,  and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed .  michael doesn't believe her story ,  but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed .  .  .  this italian film is ,  of course ,  almost innocently influenced by the exorcist ,  but this one is much cheaper ,  much simpler , and in a sense ,  much dirtier .  first of all ,  it should be said this film is full of confusion .  for instance ,  the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia .  but when emily sees her in the flashbacks ,  she perceives her exclusively from a third-person's point of view .  but if she is the reincarnation of emilia ,  she should and must see the past from nothing but emilia's point of view .  confusions of this kind ,  which the film has many ,  are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly ,  rather than ambivalent ,  to specify its own quasi-freudian theme ,  namely ,  pre-adolescent girl's one-way incestuous wish .  to make matters worse ,  this film also has characteristic problem  ( if not confusion )  ;  every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human .  regarding emily  ( or emilia )  ,  she is after all a child ,  and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness .   ( and according to the freudian theory ,  every girl wants to have her father's child ( ren )  in her own way .  in this sense ,  emily is not exclusively pathological ;  only her way of excluding other women from her father's love is problematically pathological .  but ,  as i already mentioned ,  this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian .  )  the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is .  and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down-to-earth ,  and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way .  in addition ,  special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable .  although stelvio cipriani's music is noteworthily beautiful  ( indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone )  ,  the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b-film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-italian- horror-film-lovers . 
1	up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga ,  which finally ended in 2005 ,  i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series .  the varied action scenes and really different characters  ( jabba the hut ,  furry woodland creatures ,  etc .  )  made this a particularly appealing movie .   none of the action ever focused too long in one spot ,  either .  the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader .   another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars .  gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford .  finally ,  everyone was on the same page !  it was nice to see .   in the end ,  this was simply a wonderful adventure tale ,  more than anything else . 
0	dreck about three beautiful women in california who go to cover some festival  ( or something )  .  all the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house .  what they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill .  .  .   yawn .  boring ,  pointless ,  utterly stupid  " horror "  film .  bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull dull !  bach and her friends are no actresses--their faces are blank all the way through .  the final  " revelation "  is laughably predictable and there's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way .  there is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that's not enough to save this .  boring ,  pointless and unknown  ( for good reason )  .  a 1 all the way . 
0	just a dumb old movie .  first stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way ,  and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way .  in an effort to save him ,  stanwyck gets unlucky ,  yet again ,  and comes across an escaped convict .  she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way .  in the end her husband is saved ,  and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is .  all's well than ends dumb .   i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's glamour-oriented golden era ;  that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short ,  running a little over an hour .  it's as though the director sensed that he was making crap ,  so he thought it best to keep the crap short . 
1	the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones .  the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor ,  and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two .   oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided ,  but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it .  i suppose i was thinking more  " leisure suit larry "  risqué than the producers were .  .  .   definitely not a pg-13 movie ,  which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors ,  but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones .   i liked it ,  but i doubt it will be a smash hit .  .  .   ( which is sad ,  as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to ) 
1	most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers .  this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right .  it combines elements of humour ,  suffering ,  rebellion ,  etc .  in a way that is comlex & sympathetic .  the ending could be a bit clearer ,  but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer . 
0	one :  richard pryor and jackie gleason ,  two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid .  they've both sold themselves out in this one ,  worse than pryor's character .  two :  horrible ,  overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched .  three :  choice of a black actor as the toy ;  the racial subtext of this is unbearable ,  as its never addressed .  there's no message here ,  pryor's part could have been played by any comedic actor .  four :  that kid .  .  . i wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting .  .  . that would mean movies like this one and kid co .  might not have been made .  .  . and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power .  so if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick ,  go ahead .  if you want to see them in something good ,  see pryor's old standup act and gleason in something better ,  like the honeymooners . 
0	reasons to watch the movie :   1 )  bo derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked .  she does a pretty good job playing an immature ,  insecure 16 year old beauty ,  in fact  2 )  many shots of a pretty greek island  but :   1 )  peter hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since brutus played caeser's friend in  " roman senate proceedings of march 15 .  "  he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow .  turn down the volume whenever he speaks .  preferably all the way down  2 )  bo's fantasies are sadly tame ,  especially by today's standards .  a few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model  3 )  the plot is skimpier than bo's costumes
0	this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized .  there are two routes to take in horror films :  either you don't really explain what's going on  ( or who the killer is ,  like in texas chainsaw massacre )  or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained  ( halloween could potentially be an example of this )  .   unfortunately ,  creep fails in this area .  i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation .  no character is fully realized ,  although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story .   in the end ,  this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film .   this film will go down as another example of a film  ( as most are )  that could be so much better even though it would never be great .  the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting :  the characters ,  story ,  direction ,  and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift .   creep does serve a purpose as a mindless ,  silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment ,  but sadly ,  that's about it .  .  . 
1	after a cold sex scene ,  between andy and gina ,  in south america ,  we know that andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra money we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habits he's also attempting to keep up with his wife ,  who just might be having an affair   to solve all their problems ,  he persuades his brothera likable loserto join him in a plan to steal their own parent's small store their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in new york's westchester county sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of desperation   three main characters are important in this movie  first the two brothers each of them is a complex individual ,  threatened with multiple motivations ,  and sunk into doubts and disappointments the two are desperate characters ,  financially and emotionally  andy is selfish he feels that he has never had the love of his father he is the corrupting influence ,  turning his brother into an assailant ,  and his beautiful woman into an adulteress  hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes his ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support .  he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father   the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson  ( albert finney )  ,  especially in the haunting climactic scenes  telling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film ,  and therefore the entertainment .  .  .   tomei's performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look ,  her touch ,  her particular move  lumet's direction is firm ,  fresh and brutal . 
1	the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive .  it's too much for my budget at the moment ,  or i would purchase it ,  because the film is a good example of film noir .  .  . and i enjoy watching richard widmark ,  jean peters and thelma ritter .   criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much .  that's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white ,  mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary ,  cinematography-wise .   the story is the story here  ( as opposed to visuals ,  actors ,  sound ,  sets ,  etc .  )  as a pickpocket  ( widmark )  inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters' purse .   ( say that three times !  )  .  everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie :  widmark ,  the cops ,  the u . s .  agents and the communists and ,  especially ritter as  " moe ,  "  an informant .  she and widmark are the stars of this film .   peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by  " falling in love "  with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her .  only in world of film !  !  too bad ,  because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it .   this an average film noir which means good ,  but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35 .  for that price ,  one could do a lot better in the film noir market . 
1	i know ,  that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of  lineage- it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives  and the men .  .  .  films dealing with men who are in the hospital  dealing with tragic circumstances .  but this film is full of wonderful  surprises and performances .  it features stellar performances from  eric stoltz and helen hunt  ( including a rather risque nude scene )   and wesley snipes and william forsythe .  as emanuel levy wrote  in his book cinema of outsiders  ( about the independent film  movement )   " the waterdance is coherant ,  attentive to detail ,  and  unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at once  funny and sad ,  and the entire cast is impressive .  "  i was  extraordinarily moved by this film ,  it's hard hitting yes ,  but also has  very tender moments and laugh out loud moments .  a rare gem . 
0	as a former submariner ,  this was one of the worst submarine movies i have ever seen .  first of all ,  a mutiny aboard any us naval vessel ,  particularly a nuclear powered trident submarine in unthinkable .  these men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission .  the responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the most junior crew member .  i could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer .  an executive officer who acted as the character played by denzel washington did would be relieved of his duties and court martialed ,  then drummed from the navy .  it is no surprise the navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film .  lastly ,  if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded .  submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection .  they don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway .  i was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway .  loud music would never be tolerated .  i know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets ,  but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous .  i would not recommend this movie to anyone . 
1	i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york .  it was a pretty creepy movie ,  though not as good as horror hotel .  i just bought this movie on dvd ,  and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and/or italian and no subtitles are provided .  then the other actors respond in english to what was being said .  kind of weird .  also on the dvd box ,  the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb .   aside from that ,  this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth  ( barbara steele )  to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists .  that scene existed in the tv version ,  but it was very edited .  i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition ?  it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions .  where are the master tapes and all the unused footage ?    aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle ,  the rest of the movie is pretty good .  there aren't too many special effects  ( but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one )  .  the creepy atmosphere and the strange ,  exotic ,  and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be .  i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film ,  it would be a big zero .  she makes the movie a ten ! 
1	mark frechette stars as mark ,  a college radical leftist .  mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot ,  and he flees all the way to the desert .  he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport ,  and flies it himself .    once out flying over the desert ,  mark spots a car from the air .  a young woman named daria steps out ,  and sees mark circling in the plane .  mark swoops the plane very low several times ,  causing daria to duck or get hit .  when he lands ,  he becomes acquainted with daria ,  who is strangely charmed by mark's aerial highjinks .    after engaging in soulful conversation for hours ,  mark and daria get naked ,  and make love in the sand .  but with mark evading the law ,  they realize that he needs to keep running .  so mark and daria's brief tryst is quite poignant ,  because it doesn't get to develop into a full-blown romance .   zabriski point was the eraserhead of the early 70s .  both films have a rambling ,  vague quality ,  along with complicated meanings and characters .  frechette was as reckless in person ,  as his character was in this film .  a few years after making zabriski point ,  frechette robbed a bank in real life .  while serving his prison sentence ,  mark died an ignoble death .  he was killed by a 150 lb .  weight ,  which fell on him when he was weightlifting .    the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography ,  and special visual effects .  the incredible ,  slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion ,  were a stroke of genius .  although not as ground-breaking a film as easy rider was ,  zabriski point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture .  i recommend it ,  for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval ,  of the youth rebellion during the early 70s . 
1	i have to admit to enjoying bad movies .  i love them i watch all of them .  horror especially .  my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work ,  rent some crazy tapes ,  order a pizza and have a blast .  this one had a great box ,  so i was expecting less than usual .   the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed ,  and the other underground layers are simply covered up .  the inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave .  this wakes up some zombies .   from this point on ,  it's chunk-city .  the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll .   ok ,  it's not great art ,  but this one ,  with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening .  actually ,  it was one of the best  " party tapes "  i have ever had the pleasure of watching .  and you could tell it was done on no money ,  with a bunch of crazy people .  there are hundreds of zombies ,  and the director looks like brendan frazer  ( he has a cameo )  and it is just a wild trip . 
1	i first saw this movie on some movie channel  ( hbo ?  )  some time ago .  i was a fan of public enemy ,  nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters .  anyway ,  the promo for it caught my eye ,  and i wanted to see what it was all about .  well ,  right off the bat i knew it was going to be good  ( warning !  )  and i was right .  the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over  ( my peanuts )  ,  but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great .  you've got to love the satire of rap groups  ( obviously nwa )  ,  certain rappers  ( eazy e ,  flava flav ,  ice cube )  ,  and the humor of the three members of nwh .  who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass ?  it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved ,  as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases ,  but in my opinion is a much better film .  if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap ,  you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time .  if you aren't into or don't like 'rap' ,  you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre . 
1	big splashy film of the broadway music .  nathan  ( frank sinatra )  loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games .  blonde loving adelaide  ( vivian blaine )  wants to marry him if he gives up craps .  he decides on one last game when sky masterson  ( marlon brando !  )  ,  who bets big ,  is in town .  he bets sky that he can't get mission worker sarah brown  ( jean simmons )  to go with him to havana .  that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie !   this is a real mixed bag--there's some wonderful stuff here .  the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible .  the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end .  also brando is really quite good here--it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off .  i have to admit seeing big ,  bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun !  also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend .  her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here .   now for the bad parts--jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab colorless role and can't do much with it .  the movie is far too long at 150 minutes--the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened .  also most of the characters speak in very precise english--contractions are never used .  maybe it's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie .   it's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while .  i give it a 7 . 
0	i've always been enthusiastic about period dramas ,  an art form in which the bbc has excelled in the past .  this presentation of  " byron "  was unbelievable .  unbelievably bad !  the script was dreadful ,  the acting uninspired ,  and all the characters woefully insipid .  apparently byron was  " mad bad and dangerous to know "  ,  and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter .  not in this production .  here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the greek struggle for independence .  it is said that byron walked with a limp .  this portrayal of the man was just limp all over .   i watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life .  not a splutter ,  not even a glimmer .  it was utter tedium ,  if not downright boredom ,  from start to finish .   having the opinion that no-one will ever better the bard of avon ,  i also believe that byron's poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner ,  and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment .   i think the bbc lost its nous with this one
1	this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces  (  " the fall of the house of usher "  ,   " dance of death "   ( poem )   )  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end .  it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  ( for example ,   " the cat and the canary "  ,   " the old dark house "  ,   " night of terror "  and so on )  .  boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests .  he dies early in the film  ( or does he  ?   )  and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences .  i won't go into too much detail here ,  but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries .   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room .   dan basinger 8/10
0	the book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you ,  but then ,  as it diverges more and more from the book ,  taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches ,  it becomes boring .  still ,  from comments i've heard ,  people who have not read the book tend to like it ,  and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time ,  it will have served its purpose .  the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins' uncle albert  ( i love to laugh )  .  nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .

1	a charming romantic comedy .  the plot is a little too complicated--i tried to summarize it three times and i can't .  suffice to say it's worth seeing .  the movie is funny ,  beautiful--the plot is totally unrealistic but it works .  everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great--it creates a sweet ,  romantic feel through the entire film .    the acting is great--robert downey jr .  and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it .  ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine .  if you're a sucker for good ,  sweet sentimental films  ( like me )  ,  catch this one .  also downey looks great in his underwear !   extra bonuses--the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song  " after all "  sung by cher and peter cetera . 
0	as a  " jane eyre "  fan i was excited when this movie came out .   " at last ,  "  i thought ,   " someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author .  "  wrong !  !  !  if the casting director was intending to cast a  " jane "  who was plain he certainly succeeded .  however ,  surely he could have found one who could also act .  where was the tension between jane and rochester ?  where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere ?  where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother ?  finally ,  why was the plot changed at the end ?  one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book .  what a disappointment
0	carlos mencia continually ,  violently ,  hatefully screaming  " b**ch !  "  at women is like screaming  " n**ger !  "  at black people ,  except it's worse .  remember ,  the b word ,  unlike the n word ,  is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence .   " b**ch !  "  is the last thing women hear before they are raped ,  beaten ,  or murdered .  this guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence .  sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman-bashing ,  so that he will sound like a hetero .  and how about all the nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side ,  clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman-hating .  tee hee hee .  bet mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for them !  come on ,  carlos  do you want women to have the free speech to b**ch-slap you as loudly and violently and big-mouthed as you do ,  or do you think  " free speech "  is only for men to crap on women ?  ?  ? 
0	wow .  rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately ,  but this one especially is begging for a beatdown .  let's start at the beginning .  first ,  writer-director susan montford puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role ,  complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence .  let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite .  montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable .   when she goes out for some christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night ,  della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year .  she decides to do something about it ,  so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield .  the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall .  when she finally gets to her car ,  the thugs confront her about the note ,  a cop is killed ,  and she runs ,  and they catch up to her ,  and she gets away ,  and they chase her some more ,  and on and on .  everything is completely predictable and uninvolving .  the thugs are not scary or menacing at all ,  and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways .   this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine .  why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me .  and once ,  just once ,  in a film like this ,  does the leader of the pack have to die last ?  what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ?  much of the movie simply consists of lukas haas running around in the woods screaming  " della !  !  !  "  and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting .   the part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when della ,  exhausted and hurt ,  cries out to the heavens ,   " where are you ,  god ?  "  where ,  indeed ,  was god when this movie was being made ?  i give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting ,  and it's not as bad as 'btk killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film .  cheers ! 
0	i went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful .  and it was .  i really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- kathy bates was a wonderful actress .  .  .  before she made this movie- vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for .  fred's dad ,  played by trevor peacock  ( of vicar of dibley fame ,  amongst others )  ,  had about one line .   the plot was predictable and all over the place ,  and the humour was .  .  .  lacking .   ( however ,  there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family .  .  .  that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic )  don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train  ( actually- maybe the train would be better .  .  .  ) 
0	for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and  " film-making "  .  as a reminder to those that live here - locales include boulder creek ,  bonny doon ,  davenport ,  big basin .  etc .  the bank was the bc firehouse ;  chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236 ,  empire grade rd ,  and hwy 1 .   production :  jeffrey jones was the most approachable ,  matt broderick was above us all - even back then .  as far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level .  a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery .   additional notes ;  joe's bar  ( jed's tavern in the film )  ,  original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw - the old erba's parking lot was the town square ,  the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek ;  turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days . 
0	well ,  it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said .  but the thing is ,  i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen .  so ,  i have to write something .   the acting is stupid .  it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash .  the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child .  the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be .  don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary .  we don't see how the granpa is killed .  the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die ,  you just don't sympathize with them .  and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better .  we just hear him scream and we see nothing ! 
0	my favorite part was when the credits started to roll .  i wish i could give it a  . 0000000000001 out of 10 .  i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back .  don't waste your money or time on it .  i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards .   nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career .  but she chose to be in it .   all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked .  more than kazaam and glitter combined .  that's saying something .   don't  do  it !  !  !  ! 
0	i found a dvd of  " i dream of jeanie "  in the $1 . 00 bin at wal-mart .  when i saw that it was the  " story of stephen foster "  ,  being a musician and music educator ,  i had to see it .  i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover ,  just that it was a remake of 1939's  " sewanee river "  .  bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful ,  sometimes laughable .  the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through !  i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs .  .  . without paying him for them !  in addition to that ridiculous notion ,  there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black-faced  " christy minstrels "  performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch ,  to say the least .  i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time .  it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten .  fortunately ,  stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten .  .  .  . also ,  eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history . 
1	this is the true story of how three british soldiers escaped from the german prisoner of war  ( pow )  camp ,  stalag luft iii ,  during the second world war .  this is the same pow camp that was the scene for the great escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the gestapo  ( and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name )  .    while the other pows in stalag luft iii are busy working on their three massive tunnels  ( known as tom ,  dick & harry )  ,  two enterprising british prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence ,  shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom .  the idea to build their version of the trojan horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some pows playing leap-frog in the compound .   initially containing one ,  and later with two pows hidden inside ,  the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position ,  near the fence ,  on a daily basis .  while volunteer pows vaulted over the horse ,  the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire ,  under the wire ,  and into the woods .    the story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping pows faced while traveling through germany and occupied europe after they emerged from the tunnel .  all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs  ( escaped successfully to their home base .  )  .  the wooden horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a pow breakout .  the movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two pows traveled in their escape .  made with far less a budget than the great escape ,  the wooden horse is more realistic if not more exciting than the great escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the pows to make good their escape .    the story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie .  the wooden horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees ,  eric williams ,  and is ,  by far ,  the best pow escape story ever made into a movie .  some of the actual pows were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in stalag luft iii .  i give this movie a well deserved ten . 
1	i agree with  " jerry .  "  it's a very underrated space movie  ( of course ,  how many good low-budget ones aren't underrated ?  )  if i remember correctly ,  the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation  ( but not  " rip-off "  )  of 2001 ,  because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man ,  who had somehow been turned into a computer .  and like hal ,  they tried to disconnect his  " mind "  ,  but not the mechanical parts of him ,  and as with hal ,  it led to disaster .  there is at least one funny moment .  when the christopher cary character ,  who can't find any food ,  finds the abandoned pet bird ,  there's a kind of ominous moment ,  but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all . 
0	yes ,  marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running .   dresler is good .  never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen .   i watched this for polly moran ,  whom i've seen elsewhere .  here ,  moran is ok -- just ok -- as dressler's shrewish friend/foe .  too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion .   the plot is good hearted .  bad guys try to rob the townspeople .  dressler triumphs and all ends well .   i do wonder about the central plot mechanism :  bonds .  this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly .  i ,  however ,  not of that era ,  am vaguely familiar with them .  they're like stocks only different ,  right ?  it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity . 
0	this is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered ,  but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted .  .   as far as pure film-making technique goes ,  this director is competent .  he's held back by the limited budget and the vhs camera ,  but the actual editing ,  camera angles ,  camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional .  i've seen many movies where the  " directing "  was much worse .  at least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there .  also ,  the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere .  there is only so much you can do with a vhs camera ,  and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go .  as far as artistic merit ,  there is none .  the scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film .  this is pure trash .  .  .  total garbage .   the gore is decent for a film in this budget range .   ,  it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it ,  and it's very outlandish .  .   i saw the american version with the intentionally campy dubbing .  this was a good idea  ( and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film )  .  .  .  unfortunately ,  it's overdone ,  especially towards the end .   it's really a terrible film ,  but i have to recommend it for it's camp value .  it's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category . 
0	georgia rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life .  the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp ,   " what ?  "  out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course .   advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - jane fonda as the matriarch ,  felicity huffman as her daughter ,  and lindsay lohan as the rebellious ,  over- sexed ,  scantily clad grand-daughter ,  the viewer thinks this will be a cliché ,  light ,  chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family .   talk about false advertisement at it worst .   after many shots of animals doing  " funny "  things in the background of  " pivotal "  scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed ,  or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohan's character being sexually abused by her step-father ,  georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema  :  the ungrounded ,  horribly acted ,  inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward ,  surreal ,  strange way .  if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy ,  then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums .  sideways .  junebug .  and so on .  and so on .   the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation .  say that the movie ,  the 40 year old virgin ,  was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child .  but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn ,  belly laughs and comedy would ensue ,  with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake ,  lifeless ,  human beings pretending to care .    throw in a yellow parakeet ,  dermot mulroney as the flattest ,  most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script ,  along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy ,  too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he ,  as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene ,  unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other ,  and you've got georgia rule .   i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers ,  screenwriters ,  actors ,  editors ,  etc .  . who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed .   don't see this movie  :  my rule .    and if you must ,  get sufficiently drunk before hand . 
1	raggedy ann & andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters .  my dad took my sister and i ,  and the funny thing is - when we got home ,  dad asked us  " what do you want to do now ?  "  and we said we want to watch raggedy ann & andy again !  lol ,  and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how i remember it .  i was five years old at the time .   this movie was pretty scary for a five year old .  the scene with the giant ocean of sweets ,  and the hypnotic camel scene .  .  i don't remember a lot from this film ,  naturally ,  the beginning was magical ,  and a few scenes -- i wish i could find it again ,  and will likely seek it out now .   i remember i loved raggedy ann & andy . 
0	worst show i've ever seen .  the story is about a group of teenagers who ,  for some inexplicable reason ,  have super powers ,  and when they use some special device ,  they morph into strange ,  poorly designed suits .  the acting when they're not in the retarded-looking suits is decent .  definitely not good ,  but not the worst acting i've ever seen .  however ,  when wearing their suits ,  the actors' acting goes from bad to worse ;  much ,  much worse .  the hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do .  even when they talk they look like they're having seizures .  the villains are stupider than the rangers .  every episode ,  some weak ,  idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the rangers .  he/she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the rangers .  the rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation ,  then they annihilate the aliens .  then ,  the poorly designed villain ,  which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil ,  to a humanoid ladybug-like creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation .  the power rangers fight the villain off ,  then the villain turns into godzilla ,  whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile  ( yes ,  they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants )  .  the power rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summon their zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real .  the power rangers win ,  the villain gets mad ,  they all teach a  " valuable "  lesson ,  and the show ends .  that's it .  twenty-five minutes of brain-washing ,  fake kung fu fighting . 
1	it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent ,  stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves .  they should make this the official and only true real hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's  " hamlet "  .   it's a perfect ,  complete version of the play ,  potent ,  massive ,  earthshaking first-class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of .  they've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career .  every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction .   the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses .  branagh is phenomenal in the leading role .  his sharp ,  irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history .  every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end .  branagh's version of  " hamlet "  is among the ten best motion pictures ever . 
1	a strong woman oriented subject after long ,  director krishna vamsi's shakti- the power ,  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi's first home-production .  a story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice .   the story of the film revolves around nandini  ( karisma kapoor )  who lives in canada with her two uncles  ( tiku talsania ,  jaspal bhatti )  .  there she meets shekhar  ( sanjay kapoor )  ,  falls in love with him and they soon marry .  their family is complete when nandini has a boy ,  raja  ( master jai gidwani )  .  but their happiness is short lived ,  as the news of shekhar's ailing mother  ( deepti naval ) makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india .  and that's when the problems start .  from the moment they reach  india ,  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere .  they take a crowded train to reach shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station ,  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village .  the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive .  and unfortunately for them ,  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus .  fortunately ,  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him .  after that ,  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar''s father ,  narsimha  ( nana patekar )  lives with his wife  ( deepti naval )  .  nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place ,  but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome .   living there ,  nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him .  the day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb ,  she loses it and lashes out against him ,  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada .  but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day ,  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law .  her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film .   what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie .  the only drawback is ismail darbar''s music ,  which fails to rise above the script .  the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena ,  which has been composed by anu malik .  another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast .  karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother .  she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal .  second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film .  his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role .  sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors .  deepti naval too is in top form and her pr-climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy .  shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value .  though his role was not really required ,  he's done it well .  overall ,  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening .  shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up .  so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact .  shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch ! 
1	i have ,   " things to come ,  "  on d . v . d .  and it's very clear compared to my vhs version .  the audio is fair ,  but can be hard to understand at times .    i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it . it gave details of why some things happened .  the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first .  such as ,  john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party ,  like it was a dive bomber ,  out dateing sea power by naming a battleship ,  " dinosuar .  "  ships sunk by air-power ,  an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes .  swept flying wing planes .  strong rolls for the women through the entire movie .    there are more ,  see the movie to enjoy them . 
1	in the spirit of the classic  " the sting "  ,  this movie hits where it truly hurts .  .  .  in the heart !  a prim ,  proper female psychiatrist ,  hungry for adventure ,  meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals .  the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman ,  and begs to be involved in his operation .  while the movie moves kind of  " slow "  ,  it's climax and ending are stunning !  you'll especially enjoy how the doctor  " forgives herself "  ! 
0	this isn't a film ,  it's a 111-minute evangelical christian sermon draped over red state america's #1 sport ,  high school football .  another of the long ,  earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours .   dialogue like  " you won the big one when you accepted christ "  loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director/coach alex kendrick's sunken black eyes .  then there are the  " parables "  .   two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it .  which one do you think god blessed ?  this rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax ,  in the course of which coach asks his trepidous back-up kicker ,   " son ,  do you think god could help you make that kick ?  "  it's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith-based funding ad infinitum ,  if only the evangelical christian bush administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become  " devout "  after their example .  behold that poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finale ,  urging his team on crying  " who's with me !  "  while the devout eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the lord's work .   so ,  do you think our terrified back-up makes his kick to vanquish those self-centrist goliaths ?  well ,  we all know zealots can't lose .  put it this way :  transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the middle east ,  replace the christian proselytizing ,  and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a taliban-vs-superpower parable ,  which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute .   luckily they won't care ,  nor need to :  like coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame ,  the answers are all right here in this book .  and the christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture ,  that final victory they have prepared their fields for . 
1	as the story in my family goes ,  my dad ,  milton raskin ,  played the piano for the dorsey band .  after sinatra joined the band ,  my dad practiced with him for hours on end .  then ,  at a point in time ,  my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group  ( band )  ,  and that he should venture off on his own .  by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that !  dorsey never forgave my dad ,  and the rest ,  as they say ,  is history .   i have some pictures and records to that effect ,  and so does berkley university in california .   i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say ,  and his movies never get old  .   .   .  thank you frank
0	i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties .  i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil .  laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america .  they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself  " the devil "  she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy .  maidens are chained up .  the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner .  peter weston ,  is the devil hunter ,  who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her , 
0	an excellent performance by alix elias highlights an otherwise mis-directed and confused pile of dreck .  i have seen this movie ,  perhaps 12 times ,  and with each run through ,  i find less and less pleasure .  why are munchies so lustful ?  is that ever explained ?  are they a reflection of our wanton ,  boorish 'animal selves ? ' if they are ,  why not make it more obvious ?  why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie ,  and make that connection explicit ?  another part of this movie that bothers me to no end - motorcycles .  the jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest 'street-wise' traveler .  the sun glasses say 'pretty cool dude . ' with all this i'm ready for easy rider meets the muppets .  all i get is munchies  ( 1987 )  .  what gives ?  stick to the gremlins series if you're a fan of diminutive ,  wise-cracking ,  reptile puppets - it'll give you the treatment you deserve . 
0	there's not a drop of sunshine in  " the sunshine boys "  ,  which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment .  simon ,  who adapted the script from his play  ( which goes uncredited )  ,  equates old age with irrational behavior--and ,  worse ,  clumsy ,  galumphing ,  mean-spirited irrational behavior .  walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special  ( it's said they were a team for 43 years ,  which begs the question  " how long did vaudeville last ,  anyway ?  "  )  .  burns ,  who won a supporting oscar ,  has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in ,  after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back .  the noisier the movie gets ,  the less tolerable and watchable it is .  director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of neil simon's screenplays ;  here ,  ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur ,  hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off  ( such as semi-incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a tv commercial )  .  at this point ,  matthau was still too young for this role ,  and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering .  it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character ,  to nuance his temperament to give  " the sunshine boys "  some sunniness ,  yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf .  the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace ;  one loses hope for it early on .  *1/2 from ****
1	one of my favorite shows back in the '70s .  as i recall it went to air on friday  ( or possibly saturday ) night on the nine network  (  ?  )  here in australia .  darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together .   each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent .  to their credit ,  the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible .   i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital .  the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames .  oh well  .  .  .  .  you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea .   mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best .   definitely deserves a place in tv's  " hall of fame "  .  to quote tony vincenzo  .  .  .  .  'kolchack you are on it ' .  .  .  or ,  in the case of the hall of fame , 'in it'  ! 
0	this film is basically two hours of dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death .  the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised .  it was just a grim ,  sad waste of time .   willem dafoe is excellent actor .  peter stormare is an excellent actor .  but this film just sucked .  slow doesn't make the movie bad ,  it was just bad .  the sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives ,  finally at the end .  i really appreciate the artistic vision ,  but as entertainment ,  it put me to sleep .   ( seriously ,  i fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing .  )   i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others ,  even when they suck ,  but this film warranted one .  it's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result . 
0	i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released .  in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks ,  as if it were some incredible blockbuster film .  it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema ,  and i was put off going for years to come .  the following week i was invited to go and see the new film  " star wars "  and i declined .  to this day i have never seen it ,  in protest at having to watch sasquatch !  seriously ,  even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage .  it's just so bad ,  it's almost unbelievable .  rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema .  i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again ,  just as well as far as i'm concerned .  avoid at all costs !  !  ! 
0	it's hard to believe an  " action "  packed jet li movie could be so boring ,  but this was transcendant trash .  the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks .  the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent .    it's a comic book story about a group of super-human soldiers who are to be killed because they're mentally unstable ,  one of their number  ( li )  who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian .  the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world ,  and li sheds his new life to save the world .   the version i saw was dubbed ,  and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin plot and comic-book 25 cent special effects .  but i suspect even ninja-turtle-watching 8-year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow . 
0	i rented this shortly after renting ben stein's  " expelled "  and thought it would interesting to compare them .  before i go further ,  it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i'm prejudiced or not .  i'm trying to be objective ,  for the record .   i tend to enjoy maher's hbo show now and then ,  though i rarely think he's the source of the humor .  i don't really care for his stand-up either .  but he makes some good points on the show now and again ,  and i liked politically incorrect ,  though he was still fairly politically correct  ( which i deem a negative because the very term sounds orwellian or at least fascist )  .  as for my religious views ,  i'll say for simplicity's sake that i'm a non-denom .  christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in .   that being said ,  this a bad  " documentary "  for reasons that haven't been touched on yet by many reviewers--though the ones mentioned are valid too .  the reason it's not convincing isn't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk  ( and his point boils down to nothing logical either ,  it's just  " come on ,  really ?  "  which isn't a point ,  just a question .  try david hume if you want a decent argument .  )  .  the reason this isn't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter .  i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn't a clergyman .  there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with masters or doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring ,  particularly in the fields of history ,  anthropology or a host of others .   if one compares this to ben stein's  " expelled :  no intelligence allowed "  he'll find that stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors ,  professionals ,  clergy ,  etc .  he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds .  he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education .  maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this .  instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century's secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio-political power !  !  !  !   ( it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the anne frank house i think .  )  this is a true orwellian head-trip .  he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deaths--which has had its share ,  though far smaller than most !  ! --without even including a basic view of the evidence .  perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism's miserable record of the 20th century alone .   another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or  " average "  practitioner .  he picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd .  how difficult is that ?  how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule ?  it does not .  wow ,  so people in cults think outside of the norm ?  how enlightening to know this .  great work maher !  again ,  it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on refuting the idea of  " patriotic duty "  that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in .   beyond all that ,  he's just not that funny here .  some of the clips that are overlaid in  " clever "  out of context/irreverent ways might garner a laugh ,  but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from maher will not be forthcoming ,  much less convincing .  he spends most of his time bashing christians ,  spouting inaccuracies ,  and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn't allow to really answer his questions .   for the record ,  there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves .  he touches on almost none of these .  i get the feeling that i could've responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed ,  but the whole thing reeks of deck-stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out . 
1	have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films ,  but i thought this one was very well done .  the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction .  the angles ,  settings ,  and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped .  many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over  ( always a sign of a good director )  . 
1	larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum .  well ,  the worst mistake ,  evidently ,  is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted .  obviously ,  this is not a true horror movie ,  at least ,  not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying .     " wendigo "  is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles .  things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend .  it is obvious that kim ,  the mother ,  is a psychologist ,  but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son .  this is also a story of alienation .  it's clear that the father ,  george ,  is a distant figure ,  perhaps a workaholic ,  who seems to be living in a different world .   miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country .  that part of new york state ,  with its winter landscape ,  barren trees ,  play havoc on the little boy's imagination .  it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town ,  it creates even more doubts in his young mind .  ultimately ,  miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything ,  even evoking the wendigo spirit .   the film is well paced and acted .  patricia clarkson is excellent ,  no matter where movie she is in .  jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand .  erik per sullivan ,  as miles ,  conveys the inner turmoil within him .  i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him .  finally ,  john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis ,  a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out .   instead of putting this movie down ,  future viewers should approach it with a open mind . 
1	i first saw this back in the early 90s on uk tv ,  i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it ,  many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again ,  the main thing that stuck with me was the end ,  the hole castle part really touched me ,  its easy to watch ,  has a great story ,  great music ,  the list goes on and on ,  its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it ,  yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch ,  it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty ,  i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top 10 films of all time .  buy it or rent it just see it ,  best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film .   enjoy
1	first of all ,  this film was not released to theatres  ( tested poorly they say )  , i say they figured the story of crooked cops ,  politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death , just send it dvd & cable tv> & take the money & run .   that being said i usually like this type of movie ,  especially with this named cast .  morgan freeman ,  justin timberlake ,  kevin spacey ,   l . l . cool j ,  cary elways ,  john heard & on the distaff side ,  piper perabo & roslyn sanchez .   the plot & story have been done to death ,  but the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable .   justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by morgan freeman ,  the others are either crooked cops , & politicians or somewhat decent guys ,  the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j & justin timberlake & do whats required ,  it is quite violent ,  many killings etc ,  not for children .  by no means is the a great film ,  but for what it is & the cast it is definitely good ,   ratings ***  ( out of 4 )  86 points  ( out of 100 )  imdb 8  ( out of 10 ) 
0	i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny ,  but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs .   its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine ,  and try to get the respect they deserve .   the acting is really good .  dabney coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy ,  not really evil ,  just unlikeable .  dolly partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here .  jane fonda is so-so and does little for me .  lily tomlin is the best thing about this movie ,  she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times ,  gotta love her .   i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy .  i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like .  it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters .  they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' i just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie .  as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down ,  only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true .   4 out of 10 stars ,  but give it a try if you haven't seen it .  i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable . 
1	i think this movie is well done and realistic .  i you are used to watching hollywood  " action "  movies ,  and use that as a standard to rate this movie ,  you are bound to be disappointed .  this movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what hollywood can produce ,  and that is what lifts it above the average action movie .  i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever ,  and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act .  but as i have seen the  " making of "  extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes .  this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch .  high quality realistic story and movie . 
0	a chemical spill is turning people into zombies .  it's up to two doctor's to survive the epidemic .  it's an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be .  bad acting ,  horribly awful special effects ,  and no budget to speak of .  the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement ,  much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb .  my original review of merely one word :  crap wouldn't fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is .  but i don't know if i can ,  so .  .  wait i think i may have enough words ,  or lines rather to make this review pass .  which is cool ,  i guess .  so in summation :  this movie sucks balls ,  don't watch it .   my grade :  f
1	coming immediately on the heels of match point  ( 2005 )  ,  a fine if somewhat self-repetitive piece of  " serious woody ,  "  scoop gives new hope to allen's small but die-hard band of followers  ( among whom i number myself )  that the master has once again found his form .  a string of disappointing efforts ,  culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda  ( 2004 )  and the embarrassing anything else  ( 2003 )  raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy ,  with or without his own participation as an actor ,  was in the cards .  happily ,  the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoop's clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy .   even more encouraging ,  woody's self-casting - sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years - is here an inspired bit of self-parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters .  in scoop ,  allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman ,  an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage-patter who ,  much like woody himself ,  has brought his act to london ,  where audiences - if not more receptive - are at least more polite .  like chaplin's calvero in limelight  ( 1952 )  ,  sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative .  moreover ,  because they seem in character ,  allen's ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time .    waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot .  his fake magic body-dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel  ( ian mcshane )  ,  a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim .  introduced on a river styx ferryboat-to-hades ,  strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can't rest in eternity without communicating one last  " scoop "  about the identity of the notorious  " tarot killer .  "  unfortunately ,  his initial return from the dead leads him to waterman's magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate ,  sondra pransky  ( scarlett johansson )  ,  who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician's climactic trick .  sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father .  as demonstrated in lost in translation ,  johansson has a talent for comedy ,  and the querulous by-play between her and allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance .   scoop's serial killer plot ,  involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect ,  peter lyman  ( hugh jackman )  ,  is the no doubt predictable result of allen's lengthy sabbatical exposure to london's ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore .  yet other facets of scoop  ( as of match point )  also derive from woody's late life encounter with english culture .  its class structure ,  manners ,  idiom ,  dress ,  architecture ,  and ,  yes ,  peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire .  when ,  for instance ,  sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club ,  waterman observes  " from his point of view we're scum .  "  a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering waterman's insistent borscht-belt jewish plebeianism .  and ,  then ,  of course ,  there is waterman's hilarious exit in a smart car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road .   as usual ,  allen's humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in-jokes ,  taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as ,  increasingly ,  references to his own filmography .  in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references ,  for instance ,  the film's soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of grieg's  " the hall of the mountain king ,  "  compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m ,  the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre .  the post-funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose  ( 1984 )  .  references to deconstructing harry  ( 1997 )  include the use of death as a character  ( along with his peculiar voice and costume )  ,  the use of mandelbaum as a character name ,  and the mention of adair university  ( harry's  " alma mater "  and where sondra is now a student )  .  moreover ,  the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite  ( 1995 )  .   as to quotable gags ,  allen's scripts rely less on one-liners than they did earlier in his career ,  but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones .  to a question about his religion ,  waterman answers :   " i was born in the hebrew persuasion ,  but later i converted to narcissism .  "  and sondra snaps off this put-down of waterman's wannabe crime-detecting :   " if we put our heads together you'll hear a hollow noise .  "  all in all ,  scoop is by far woody allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade . 
0	pointless ,  humourless drivel .  .  .  .  . meant to be a comedy ;  but not one laugh in the whole film .  gratuitous violence often with guns .  what kind of warped mentality can either make or say this is a good film ?  !  1 out of 10 . 
0	this entry is certainly interesting for series fans  ( like myself )  ,  but yet it is mostly incomprehensible .  the plot is confusing ,  as is the sequel continuity .  some striking effects ,  to be sure ,  but we never find out what it all really means .   try to see the  " nc-17 "  workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re-rated  " r "  . 
1	after finally watching walt disney's song of the south on myspace ,  i decided to watch ralph bakshi's response to that movie-coonskin-on afro video which i linked from google video .  in this one ,  during the live-action sequences ,  preacherman  ( charles gordone )  takes his friend sampson  ( barry white )  with him to pick up pappy  ( scatman crothers )  and randy  ( philip thomas ,  years before he added michael for his middle name professionally )  as the latter two escape from prison .  during their attempt ,  pappy tells randy a tale of brother rabbit  ( voice of thomas )  ,  brother bear  ( white )  ,  and preacher fox  ( gordone )  and their adventures in harlem .  as expected in many of these bakshi efforts ,  there's a mix of animation and live-action that provides a unique point-of-view from the writer/director that is sure to offend some people .  another fascinating animated character is miss america who's a big-as in gigantic in every way-white blonde woman dressed in skin-tight red ,  white ,  and blue stars and stripes who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me !  there are plenty of such scenes sprinkled throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother bear's frontal anatomy also provided big laughs from me .  there's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a  " cockroach "  she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george herriman .  i was also fascinated hearing grover washington jr . 's version of  " ain't no sunshine "  heard as part of the score .  most compelling part of the picture was seeing the scatman himself depicted with his head in silhouette during the opening credit sequence singing and scatting to a song that has him using the n-word in a satirical way .  when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago ,  it had depicted brother rabbit in insolent mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the slogan ,   " this movie will offend everybody "  .  that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children .  that said ,  i definitely recommend coonskin to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation . 
0	i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well ,  i found it strange and completely pointless .  .  .  so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it .  wow .  what a difference .  the original one was way better .  i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement ,  it's existence did have a purpose .  it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism .  if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details ,  just ,  simply put ,  if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like ,  feel free to watch the 70s version ,  a little dated ,  but a lot better . 
1	i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best !  it's funny ,  romantic ,  and a classic .  i recommend this for all ages .  it's great for little kids because it's well ,  cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top .  i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now .  it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time .  the acting is great and it never gets old .  if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this .  i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all .   ( sorry disney )  i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows .  they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining . 
1	when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky ,  and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong .  while every movie has its flaws ,  the night listener had an exceptionally low count .   if you read the last review  ( it was hard ,  since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie )  ,  you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done .  unfortunately ,  if you read more than 3 lines into that same review ,  you discovered the poster's reason for disdain :  he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay  ( or that the production team smokes crack .  .  . apparently )  .   so ,  despite the fact that i have never written a review before ,  i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits ,  not the sexual orientation of its director .  let's go over a quick checklist first :  1 .  great plot ?  absolutely .  i won't give a shred of it away ,  but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials .  this is a thriller ,  not a horror ,  and it should be approached as such .  the story really will amaze you ,  even more so because it's true  ( and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events )  .   2 .  wonderful acting ?  oh yes .  robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast ,  and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago .  he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener ,  playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of .  .  . well ,  i'll let you see for yourself .   3 .  excellent direction ?  certainly .  now ,  unlike the other poster to which i referred ,  i actually know something about direction .  i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years .  of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference  ( the only thing that matters is if you like the direction )  ,  but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant .  .  . for example :  not the sexual orientation of the director  ( or the alleged drug habits of the production team ,  lol )  .   patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark ,  and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of  " tension and release "  rather than the messy ,  fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today .  some people can truly show you a story through their camera ,  while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera .  i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized ,  which is as an eyeball through which we all see .   4 .  lighting ,  cinematography ,  and editing ?  great all around .  i've already wrote so much ,  and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs ,  so i'll just wrap it up .   in short ,  go see this movie .  don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it ,  especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post .  enjoy the show !  -ben
0	what can i say about this film other than  " don't see it "  .  i waited and waited and waited for someting  ( or anything )  to happen and it just didn't come .  watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie .  what are they doing ?  are they solving a mystery ?  are they gathering clues ?  possibly ,  it's just hard to tell .  at the end of the movie ,  after a lot of radio signals are decoded  ( illegibly on some sort of pet monitor )  and this guy gives some lectures ,  the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible .  some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth  ( i guess they don't like sharing the wealth )  .  my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art  ( garbage !  )  and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film .  watch at your own peril ,  it's not even funny because it's so bad ,  it's just bad . 
0	this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life .   ( besides farenheit 9/11 )  .  all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80% of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore .  global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more .  most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together .  this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies .   liberal blindness !  an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage ! 
1	this was a typical grade b movie in 1940s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations .  why ?  it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch ,  george macready and dame may witty ,  as a female villain ,  of all people .   when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary ,  she certainly gets more than she bargained for .  the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise .  seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter-in-law and wife ,  respectively .  macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimed .   the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does .  why don't people believe her ? 
0	this movie ,  no correction ,  this thing ,  this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head .  i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie .  but let's try anyway .  horrible ,  bad ,  nauseating ,  tasteless ,  crap ,  vomit inducing ,  gut wrenchingly bad ,  hideous ,  nasty ,  putrid ,  there just aren't enough words in the english language !  the  " plot "  involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man .  don't ask how ,  not important .  the killer snowman runs about killing people .  how ,  you may ask ,  can a snowman kill someone ?  in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you don't have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore .  in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore .  don't watch this movie !  destroy it on sight !  for the sake of your very soul don't watch it ! 
1	i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode .  death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me .  after a few times ,  i get bored and changed the channel .  i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others .  first ,  robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland's character .  he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair .  in return ,  culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career .  out of anger ,  culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere .  i don't know .  maybe i just didn't care for this one at all .  of course ,  columbo gets him in the end .  it's just the question of how . 
0	1975's master of the flying guillotine is an amazing and wonderful film to watch .  this isn't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all .  it's because the film is so silly and so over-the-top that it is a camp classic--bad ,  but enjoyably bad .  the film stars a blind guy who has a frisbee-like device on a chain that chops off people's heads as he expertly throws this at his foes !  who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier-mache arms or that the guy was blind !  it's just a ball to watch from start to finish--and one of my favorite  " bad "  films and great to see with friends .   because of this film ,  i was eager to see the fatal flying guillotines  ( 1977 )  ,  though sadly it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knock-off--taking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable .  sure ,  it's silly fun ,  but it never comes close to master of the flying guillotine in entertainment value .  like the original film ,  there are these weird flying devices that sever heads ,  but they are quite different--with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own .  there also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what's occurring in this english-dubbed version ,  as the plot is completely incomprehensible .  however ,  at the same time ,  some of the martial arts action is very good .  while not up to the high standards of most bruce lee or sonny chiba films ,  the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot .   overall ,  this is a film that martial arts fans may like  ( despite its many ,  many ,  many ,  many shortcomings )  ,  but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous .  but ,  most importantly ,  it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying guillotine .  too bad . 
0	i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie  ( lock ,  stock and two smoking barrels ,  snatch )  had directed before ,  the problem is ,  it is possibly too stylistic .  basically jake green  ( jason statham )  is released from prison after seven years in solitary , and within two years he gambles loads of his money .  he is ready to seek revenge against the violence-prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison ,  dorothy 'mr .  d' macha  ( ray liotta )  .  in the process ,  doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease ,  oh ,  and macha puts hit men on him .  loan sharks zach  ( vincent pastore )  and avi  ( andré benjamin )  are demanding jake pays their cash back ,  and do some odd jobs for them .  the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks ,  and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi ,  and macha ,  well ,  i assume that's what it was .  also starring terence maynard as french paul ,  andrew howard as billy ,  mark strong as sorter ,  francesca annis as lily walker ,  anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel .  the are sequences involving a little bit of animation ,  repeating lines twice in different perspectives ,  and changing speeds for moments ,  and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom ,  making it a silly crime drama .  pretty poor ! 
1	a double life has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons :  the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role  ( here othello )  as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life ;  and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award  ( as well as the golden globe )  as best actor .  let's take the second point first .   is anthony john colman's greatest role ,  or even his signature role ?  i have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles .  most of his career ,  ronald colman played decent gentlemen ,  frequently in dangerous or atypical situations .  he is bulldog drummond  ( cleaned up in the goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist )  fighting crime .  he is raffles ,  the great cricket player and even greater burglar ,  trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor .  he is robert conway ,  the great imperial political figure ,  who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth ,  shangri-la .  he is dick heldar ,  manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist .  i can add sidney carton and rudolf rassendyll to this list .  but here he is not heroic .  in fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others .  it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social .   to me colman should have gotten the oscar for heldar ,  or carton ,  or conway - all more typical of his acting roles .  but the academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members .  colman's anthony john is a very good performance ,  and at one point truly scary .  when alone with signe hasso in her home ,  she at the top of a staircase and him at the base ,  they have an argument .  she demands that  " tony "  leave ,  saying she won't see him .  he stares at her ,  his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before ,  and he says ,   " oh ,  no you won't !  "  he starts moving upstairs ,  frightening hasso ,  and she runs into her room .  he stops himself and leaves .  it actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of hasso on stage ,  or of edmond o'brien ,  or his killing of shelley winters .  it showed his blind fury .  for that moment it was  ( to me )  an oscar-worthy performance .  but it is only that moment .  i'm glad he was recognized for the role ,  but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance .   his actual performance in the shakespearian role of othello is not great ,  but bearable .  too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style  ( one wonders if that was due to the coaching of walter hampden ,  who probably knew how to handle the role properly ,  or a reaction to it )  .  nowadays  " othello "  is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one .  paul robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place .  but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman ,  orson welles in his movie of othello ,  and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello .  all three white actors did the role in black face .  my personal favorite of the three is welles ,  who seems the most subtle .  but even watching welles' fine film version makes me angry that robeson never got to put his performance  ( with jose ferrer as iago )  on film .   now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role ?  i heard different things about this .  some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set .  others have found a role they have to be stimulating ,  influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life .  but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role .  it seems a melodramatic ,  hackneyed idea .   as a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with cukor ,  kanin ,  and gordon .  in 1944 a  " b "  feature ,  the brighton strangler ,  starring john loder ,  had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous  " jack the ripper "  type ,  and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind .  there was an earlier movie in the 1930s ,  in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife  ( i think the title was men are not gods ,  but i'm not sure )  .  but due to colman's name and career ,  and cukor's directing ,  it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea .  it even reached comedy  ( finally )  on an episode of cheers ,  where diane chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent ,  and they put on othello at the bar ,  just after he sees her with sam malone kissing .  only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict ,  and can't delay the production long enough  ( she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play )  .    the cast of a double life was first rate ,  and cukor's direction was as sure as ever .  so the film is definitely worth watching .  but despite giving colman an interestingly different role ,  it was not his best work on the screen . 
0	i once promised never to walk out of any film  (  a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck ,  such as rambo 3 ,  baise moi ,  deep impact )  - but mr .  seidl almost succeeded .  hundstage was a truly awful experience .  anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable ,  pathetic bunch of retards .  it shows a world where love and humanity don't exist ,  a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence .  by choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors  ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock-cartoonist deix )  director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian  ( european ?  western ?  )  suburbs .  the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies ,  violence against women and handicapped people ,  madness and degradation .  but this isn't social criticism .  this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value .  instead you get bad acting ,  bad cinematography ,  bad filmmaking .  if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes .  this is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer .  and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way .  it shows ugly people - that is not the reason why i hate it .  but it depicts average people in an ugly ,  misanthropic way .  and this is why this film is truly despicable . 
1	this movie is a true masterpiece ,  it really is .  it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick ,  full of fun ,  laughter ,  heartbreak ,  and with a little drama to keep you on your toes .    a true family film ,  homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets ,  who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners ,  following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way .  one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good .  shadow is a wonderful character ,  old ,  wise and brave ,  and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment .  chance - who wouldn't love a dog like chance ?  he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen .  and sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper ;  'here kitty kitty kitty .  .  .  not on your life ,  chubby . '   there were also lots of well made emotional scenes ,  such as sassy going over the waterfall  ( i was truly scared for her )  ,  shadow falling in the ditch  ( almost in tears )  and then the fantastic ending ,  when all three pets return home .  .  .  including good old shadow !    a favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals .  rent it or buy it now ,  and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime . 
0	if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children .  if you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case !  this movie was horrible !  main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment .  they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash .  daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services .  i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out ,  15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave .  i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute .  i wish i had never seen this movie .  it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left .  do yourself a favor ,  go see something worth your money ,  cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back ! 
1	this film was just absolutly brilliant .  it actually made me think .  during the whole movie i was confused as hell .  i loved everything about it .  .  . it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird ,  it was hard not to love it .  all of the actors were phenominal ,  and no one could have done a better job .  .  . this is one of my favorites of the year .  .  . it deserves an ocar . 
0	i just watched this movie .  in one word :  sucky !  the story is bad ,  the acting is ,  if possible ,  even worse .  the movie has one or two nice moments ,  but thats it and having those two small good moments ,  doesn't make up for anything in between ,  before or after those moments .  a montrocity of a movie ,  not even worth watching on tv .  .  . 
1	  one of the best films i've ever seen .  robert duvall's performance was excellent and outstanding .  he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life .  his character was so convincing ,  it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live ,  i give it 5 stars . 
0	 " gone with the wind "  is one of the most overrated movies in history .  it is a film loved by mothers ,  grandmothers ,  and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years .  as a zombie movie ,  it blows .  there isn't a shambling corpse in sight ,  and it's terribly light in the gore department .   " zombie 3 "  ,  on the other hand ,  is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore ,  it is better than  " gone with the wind "  .  it is also not overrated .  most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish .  it is ,  however ,  not boring rubbish .  after a terrorist steals a virus ,  he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter ,  and the chemicals leak into the ground .  the terrorist ,  who has been exposed to the nasty concoction ,  hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie .  one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady .  once she's bitten ,  lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose .  as usual for a fulci flick ,  the acting is atrocious ,  the storyline is riddled with plot holes ,  and the gore is plentiful .  turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei ,  so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature .  it is badly shot ,  too ,  poorly edited ,  and the sound design is flat .  still ,  it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing .  definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest .  or don't like  " gone with the wind "  ,  undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time . 
1	in the classic sense of the four humors  ( which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment )  ,  altman's  " h . e . a . l . t . h .  "  treats all of the humors ,  and actually in very funny ,  entertaining ways .  there's the phlegm ,  as personified by lauren bacall's very slow ,  guarded ,  and protective character esther brill ,  who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance ,  protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being .  there's paul dooley's choleric dr .  gil gainey ,  who like a fish out of water  ( perhaps more like a seal )  flops around frenetically ,  barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness .  the melancholy of glenda jackson's isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous hamlet -- even proffering a soliloquy or two .  and let's not forget henry gibson's bile character ,  bobby hammer  (  " the breast that feeds the baby rules the world "  )  .  then there's the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank  ( james garner and carol burnett ,  respectively )  ,  relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h . e . a . l . t . h .  -- a kind of world trade organization specializing in h . e . a . l . t . h .  ,  which is to say anything but health .  this is altman at his classic best . 
1	sure it was well shot and made ,  very well shot and made !  but the story was just so weak .  and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker .  not that henry fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon .  do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court .  i mean who the hell was he supposed to be ?  cousin vinnie ?  i mean come on ,   " i'll just call you jackass then "  ?  ?  ?  ?  i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i didn't really like this guy at all .  he cheats in sports ,  talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom .  how am i supposed to take this seriously .   the twist was even weaker .  i mean come on !  that was just stupid .  the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams .  saying that i liked it enough ,  it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can't say it's a bad film .  in fact i must say that i must say it's good enough ,  nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can't understand how anyone could consider it great .   i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head . 
1	i am of  " the christopher reeve generation "  it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet ,  but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role ,  and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top ,  though he just barely falls short .  that doesn't stop me from enjoying this film ,  it has a lot going for it .  it has all that a movie needs ,  a plot with beginning ,  middle ,  and end ,  plus all those parts are intelligently written .  the film is edgy both in acting and storyline ,  something a film-noir but with tights .  the story is both exciting and meaningful ,  this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy .  i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days ,  oh the glory days of hollywood ,  when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell .  .  .  the film is polished and expertly made ,  directed by lee  " roll'em "  sholem ,  best known for directing with both speed and efficiency .  it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down ,  in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight ,  including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman's point of view ,  also a few closeups of george in process work ,  and a long shot of an animated superman .    this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series .  a dvd worth owning in its own right ,  the inclusion of the film as its original whole ,  is icing on the cake .   give blood today god bless ! 
1	why does this have such a low rating ?  i really don't get it .  .  .  is it because of the bad acting ?  the bad dialogue ?  well ,  who cares about these things in cheesy low-budget horror movies ?  seriously ,  the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies .  people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low-budget movies .  those movies shouldn't be taken seriously .  period .   anyway ,  time to talk about the movie ,  right ?  well ,  i loved it !  i bought it because i expected a gorefest ,  but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad  ( most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame )  ,  but i didn't really care because the movie is hilarious !  the characters are hilarious ,  the acting is hilarious  ( bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies )  ,  the dialogue is hilarious  ( bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies )  ,  the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious ,  the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on ,  but i don't want to say too much .  .  .  but i have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it's alive lol !  oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol !   best lines in the movie :   detective manners :  *sniffs coke* detective sloane :  what the *beep* are you doing ,  manners ?  what the hell did you snort ?  what the hell is that ?  detective manners :  it's nothing man ,  it's .  .  .  ehh .  .  .  cold medicine .  .  .   detective manners :  *injects heroin in his arm* detective sloane :  what the *beep* are you doing ,  manners ?  are you *beep* insane ?  detective manners :  it's cold medicine .   detective manners :  *repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face* detective sloane :  what the hell's going on ,  manners ?  what are you doing ?  detective manners :  this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock !  he just started smashing his head on the rock !  i think he's on pcp or something !   lol ! 
0	nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing ,  but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either .  there are movies so bad they are good  ( a la ed wood or tod slaughter films )  ,  and there's just plain bad  ( like 99% of uwe boll's  " work "  )  .  this film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented mstie riffer  ( e . g .  ,  mystery science theatre 3000 )  .  thankfully while i am rather talented in that regard  ( it's how my mind works all the time )  ,  for those who are not so naturally talented in mstie riffing ,  eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off ,  painfully aware the movie  " taboo "  robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back .  even my mstie talents were barely a match for this slow paced ,  boring waste of time .  the most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it .  .  .  i rented  " taboo "  solely for the normally talented amber benson ,  who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film .  i've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue ,  the reviews to which i'd better read first .  ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location . 
1	the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published .  nolte takes the role of howard w .  campbell ,  jr .  ,  and makes it his own ,  remaining true to vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost all  ( to and )  for love .   no weaknesses in this fine adaptation . 
0	i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the '60s ,  i was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses ,  most notably ben ,  actress fay spain ,  and jody fair ,  who played angela in 1961's the young savages .  ben was one of the people at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago ,  about 1970 ,  when i had a nice chat with him and his  " career "  and life .  all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day .  wish i still had copies of those interviews ,  but time marches on ,  and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later .  ben was a really nice fellow ,  ekeing out a living  ( the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest ,  unless ,  of course they were big-name stars ,  and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars ,  at most !  good to know ben's still alive & kicking !  how 'bout a remake of creature ,  but 50 years older !  ugly then ,  uglier now ! 
0	if you want to know the real story of the wendigo ,  i suggest you pick up a copy of algernon blackwell's original story .  this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book .   i loved the book when i read it as a kid  ( in  " campfire chillers "  by e . m .  freeman ) and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out .  i was so disappointed when i finally saw it .  another thing is that there were too many pc  ( politically correct )  undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film .  when the book was written pc didn't even exist .   my suggestion is don't waste your time or money !  !  if you see it on the video store shelf leave it there . 
0	unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes .   for a short film the cinematography ,  costumes ,  sets ,  sound ,  editing and everything else is very ,  very good .  this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals ,  so the quality is to be expected .  the problem ,  as usual ,  resides in the story itself .   thing is ,  it's not really a story .  to tell a story  ( or in cinema's case ,  show a story )  you need plot and conflict .  you need things that happen to the protagonist :  events .  these events happen because the protagonist wants something and ,  for some reason ,  he can't get it .  tim watcher has no problems or goals .  he's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind .  that's it .  so what we have here is pure exposition .  instead of being shown a story ,  we're simply learning things about this tim watcher individual .  of course ,  considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film's short duration ,  it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice-over narration .  in this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we'd never glean .  in fact ,  if it wasn't for the vo we'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things .  to make it worse the vo also explains what's happening on the screen !  the images we're shown are just decoration for the text we're listening to .   i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something ,  but because the images don't stand on their own it's impossible to say that .  what's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities  ( not incredible ,  but good )  but fails to entertain ,  amuse ,  thrill or ,  at the very least ,  show a story . 
0	well ,  were to start ?  this is by far one of the worst films i've ever paid good money to see .  i won't comment on the story itself ,  it's a wonderful classic ,  but here it feels like a soap opera .  to start with ,  the acting ,  except for eric bana ,  is soap opera quality .  i've always been a fan of brad pitt ,  but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame .  the camera action doesn't help ,  either .  how it lingers on him when he's thinking ,  it just takes me back to brooke forrester's days in the lab !  peter o'toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery ,  or he is desperately in need of one .  either way ,  he looks more like linda evans than linda evans !  and to end my comments ,  diane kruger is a cute girl ,  but she sure is no helen of troy .  peterson should rather have chosen saffron burrows for the role ,  since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now . 
0	given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness  ( 81 minutes - including end credits ,  so roughly 76 minutes of actual film )  .  but what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed .   the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny .  the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spots ,  james woods' portrayal of max van sydow's character in the exorcist ,  and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film .  very unfunny was the take off of charlie's angels ,  which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene ,  basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it .   today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the exorcist and maybe of the 80s' poltergeist ,  et .  al .   hopefully scary movie 3 will take some time to put together ,  making the spoofs more enjoyable .   one thing though ,  the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna faris  ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel )  .  just for her casting and acting ability ,  i give this movie a  " 3 "  out of  " 10 "  . 
0	it is difficult to find any positives in this movie .  seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history .  the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms .  more action shots of the two cops & a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go .  of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun .  ms albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate .  ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent .  apart from ms albright this is real garbage . 
0	wow !  why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film ?  half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be .  hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be .  it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain .  spoiler :  the whole movie is this :  twitch ( played by kurupt of tha dogg pound )  gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried .  in the jail ,  a riot breaks out between rival inmates ,  one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape .  during a conjugal visit ,  twitch's fiancée and burke's ( played by bill goldberg ) daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room .  burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones .   opinion :  this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier :  the return .  the script is terrible ,  the acting is horrendous ,  the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature .  look ,  i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do .  nobody in this  " movie "  believes in the characters they play .  nobody in this  " movie can be taken seriously as an actor .  kurupt should be ashamed of himself .  his character  " twitch "  is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates .  bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd ( pretty huge dump )  .  the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening !  don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent .  it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood . 
0	i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager .  but i wanted to see it again ,  because traci lords is now earning a living as a  " serious actor "  .  what the hell was going on in the eighties ?  this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors .  definitely a waste of money . 
1	wow .  saw this last night and i'm still reeling from how good it was .  every character felt so real  ( although most of them petty ,  selfish a**holes )  and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter's feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing .  top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the north's daniel craig  ( the latter coming across as the next david thewlis )  .   and director roger michell ?  this is as far from notting hill as it's possible to be .  thank god .   watch this movie !  !  ! 
1	deanna durbin ,  nan grey and barbara read are  " three smart girls "  in this universal film from 1936 ,  which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences .  it also stars ray milland ,  mischa auer ,  charles winninger ,  john king ,  binnie barnes and alice brady .  it's a sweet story about three young women ,  now living in switzerland with their divorced mother ,  who hear their father  ( winninger )  is marrying again .  not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him ,  they board a ship to america ,  with the help of the housekeeper/nanny ,  determined to stop the wedding .  realizing that the intended ,  called  " precious "   ( barnes )  is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother  ( brady )  ,  they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count .  this is arranged by their father's accountant  ( king )  .  the man he chooses is a full-time drunk  ( auer )  ,  but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count  ( milland )  .  what a mess .   this is a delightful film ,  not cloying or overly sugary at all ,  with some nice performances ,  particularly by auer ,  milland ,  barnes and brady .  the young women are pretty and all do good work .  the emphasis ,  of course ,  is on young durbin ,  who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer .  in fact ,  her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes ,  as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice .  she sings a delightful  " il bacio "  in a police station .   one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father ,  played by charles winninger ,  not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them .  barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young ,  but the girls' mother looks way up there ,  so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger ,  more glamorous woman .  in fact ,  he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters .   universal gives durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie .  ray milland at this point was still paying his dues ,  and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is .   very entertaining and of course ,  this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna . 
1	full house was and still is a great show .  it's a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show .  there really aren't any shows like it anymore .  the kids are very cute and even though it's a bit cheesy ,  it's still good ,  especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid .  i would love to see the cast interviewed now .  anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast ,  kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd ,  should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it .  yay for full house ! 
1	another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s .   with esther rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood ,  the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord  ( black agent mr .  bookman )  as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existing .   the 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter ,  to their daughter who also aspired to attain success ,  this show was a perfect description of african-american life . 
0	i cant believe some people actually like this .  yet still call themselves batman fans .  even going as far as to say it's better than btas .  which it's not .  it should be plagiarism for them to use batman's name for this piece of crap .  it's not batman .   the whole premise of the show is ''if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you'' batman isn't all about weapons .  he uses his batarang and grappling hook and batmobile ,  thats it .  he doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone .  i don't know where the hell they got the idea for a batbot .  or whatever .  they have ruined all the villains .  mr .  freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing .  catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume .  penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft .  tall top hat .  the ventriloquist is now called scarface making the dummy the whole centerpiece for the character .  they even got a dumb idea to make him a giant !  wtf ?  and the two worst character changes are that of the joker and riddler .  they have changed riddler to a gothic/retro teenage freak .  and the joker to an acrobat with dreads .  he looks like a bob marley wannabe .  they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than b&r did !  i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat . 
1	when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan .  i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller  " was "  tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape .  it wasn't after many years that i came across  " tarzan and his mate "  ,  and then i understood .  weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker ,  gordon scott ,  jock mahoney ,  denny miller ,  miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert .   as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong ,  self minded ,  active and  " no-inhibitions "  woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made  ( tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused ;  one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it )  ;  such behaviors were unthinkable with the  " janes "  to come such as brenda joyce ,  vanessa brown ,  virginia huston or dorothy hart ,  all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle .   o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself ,  except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily ;  the combination is perfect .  another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day .    " tarzan and his mate "  stands as a fine product in its genre  ( tarzan films )  and perhaps as the best ,  though i have to admit that i also enjoyed  " tarzan's greatest adventure "   ( 1959 )  made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast  ( and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect  " all gymnasium "  physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man )  .   good for jane and her mate ! 
1	this movie is a fantastic movie .  everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing .  i know mr .  garfield was blacklisted in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd .  that being the case , why isn't this one ?  a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great .  for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr .  schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well .  anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it . if it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized .  colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film .  the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945 , film would go .  mr .  garfield did a superb job of portraying mr .  schmid .  some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr . schmid's disability but i feel he got it just right .  i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two . 
1	honestly ,  this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with .  in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent .  not only that you've got to be brave ,  athletic ,  cunning ,  etc .  it actually requires skill .  not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days .  and yet ,  they only have two seasons of it !  bull .  . they need to bring this show back !  !    although ,  they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn .  he was great .   but seriously ,  it was an amazing show .  you never knew who would be going when .  and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself !  it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to !   bring back the mole !  !  !  !  bring back the mole !  !  !  ! 
0	'baptists at our barbecue' is the best film ever made .  now ,  that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken ,  let me begin my short overview of this tacky ,  offensive ,  pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie .  first of all ,  the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa ,  and the tacky ,  overly preachy ,  whiny and stilted screenplay by f .  mathew smith .  i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro-mormon ,  and sort of anti-every other religion message .  yes ,  the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists .  it shows all the main and role-model characters being mormon ,  and being so nice and perfect ,  yet they are being picked on by the evil ,  conniving and very judgmental baptists .  it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold-hearted and ignorant baptists are ,  instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic .  i'm a part of neither religion  ( i'm actually an atheist )  ,  but this offended me ,  along with another countless amount of baptists most likely .  it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons ,  and the mormons being very accepting ,  when again ,  in reality there is a mutual like/dislike between them .  sorry ,  i didn't mean to go off on a rant .   another aspect of 'baptists at our barbecue' i didn't much care for ,  was the acting .  the performances are very amateurish and unnatural ,  especially from the female lead heather beers .  miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role ,  and i wasn't too much impressed with dan merkley ,  who's the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture ,  but i have to say he's way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers .  whoever played the town sheriff was awful also .  although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film ,  it is full of clichés .  for example ,  the main character ,  tartan  ( merkley )  ,  finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life - how cliché is that ?  to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché ,  tartan buys the poor ,  lonely heathen a puppy dog .  ugghhh !    if you want my advice ,  stay as far away from 'baptists at our barbecue' as you can .  i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion .  all i got was a ,  well ,  piece of crap .  grade :  d-  my ratings guide - a+  ( absolutley flawless )  ;  a  ( a masterpiece ,  near-perfect )  ;  a-  ( excellent )  ;  b+  ( great )  ;  b  ( very good )  ;  b-  ( good )  ;  c+  ( a mixed bag )  ;  c  ( average )  ;  c-  ( disappointing )  ;  d+  ( bad )  ;  d  ( very bad )  ;  d-  ( absolutley horrendous )  ;  f  ( not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces )  . 
0	i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie .    the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic .  steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor .  he has no passion in his play . also the action in the original  " getaway "  was fantastic .  but the remake has no action !  it is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 .    i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico .  i think this is a mistake in the story .   so i think that there was no need to remake it ,  or if they decided to remake a classic ,  they must choose an excellent actor for the first role ,  like johnny depp or brad pitt .  .  . 
1	i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror .  this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor :  dr .  terrible's house of horrible ;  garth marenghi's darkplace ;  the mighty boosh ;  snuff box .  many have imitated this show's style ,  and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality .  but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend ,  with actors mark gatiss ,  steve pemberton ,  and reece shearsmith .   together they created royston vasey ,  a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside ,  where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers ;  where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center ;  where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows ;  where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure ;  where a gypsy circus kidnaps people ;  and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on .   this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen .  by themselves ,  the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters .  the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were .  but it's also great acting :  the way they change their voices and their body movement ,  the really become other people .   most of the jokes start with something ordinary ,  from real life ,  and then blows up into something unsettling ,  sometimes gut-wrenching .  sometimes it's pure horror without a set up ,  like in papa lazarou's character .  just imagine a creepy circus owner on make-up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives .  no explanation given .  it's that creepy .  then there are the numerous references to horror movies :  se7en ,  the silence of the lambs ,  nosferatu ,  the exorcist ,  etc .   fans of horror will love it ,  fans of comedy will love it .  as any traveler entering knows ,  there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey :  you'll never leave . ' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree .  once you discover the league of gentlemen ,  you'll never want anything else ,  you'll never forget it . 
1	i have to admit ,  i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class ,  but this film really blew me away .  the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film ,  truly portraying a picture of madness .  i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness ,  helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind .  this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs .  american ,  in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending ,  exercising the imagination very little . 
1	it isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like ,  but this time i think i've found it .  it reminded me of two movies :  trainspotting  ( small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland )  and the blair witch project  ( because of the style of filming )  .   it's about the loyalty between two friends ,  one of them is coming out of jail ,  the other one hasn't been caught yet .  with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol .  as they try to find some fuel ,  they find a farm in the middle of nowhere .  the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them .  than it all goes wrong .  one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run .  what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland .  the two friends literally have to run for their lives .   apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time .  ok ,  that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place :  the scottish countryside ,  but i still find that quite amazing .  especially because this isn't actually a bad movie .  it's perhaps not the greatest movie ever ,  but they still can be proud of what they achieved .  i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie .  i give it a 7/10 . 
1	most people ,  when they think of expressionist cinema ,  look to the b&w german films of the silent and early sound eras--films that emphasized canted angles ,  extreme contrasts of light and dark ,  exaggerated performance ,  and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional ,  naturalistic modes of cinematic representation .  if we're willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema  ( and that those above-mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film )  ,  then i would argue that dodes'ka-den  ( dkd )  is a prime example of this type of film .    like dreams ,  dkd is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film ,  dabbling ,  as it does ,  in the unreal .  however ,  dkd is also ,  unlike dreams ,  a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture .  why ?  mostly ,  i think ,  it's the colors .  this was ,  i believe ,  kurosawa's first color film ,  and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors ,  creating a completely unreal contemporary japan .  we are used to the neon lights and gleaming tokyo skyscrapers ;  we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons .    dkd is ,  as i said ,  a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard ,  appearing to live in an alternate universe .  that is ,  i think ,  the point--these are the tokyo outsiders ,  the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii .  the film also represents one of kurosawa's more heartfelt movies ;  there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos  ( such as when the boy's father describes their dream home )  .  it's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning ,  john ford-like vistas and samurais .  everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this  ( ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways )  .    i will also argue ,  to the last ,  that this is kurosawa's greatest achievement .  his samurai films ,  though capable pictures ,  pale in comparison to works by kobayashi  ( hara-kiri is the greatest ,  most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid )  .  rashomon ,  hidden fortress ,  seven samurai ,  yojimbo ,  sanjuro ,  kagemusha ,  and ran are all fine films ,  but they're merely good  ( and ,  frankly ,  i think that word is too generous for hidden fortress and kagemusha )  .  dkd is a great movie ,  as is ikiru .  they are the crown jewels that show akira was not a one-trick samurai pony .  they reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema . 
0	what does the  "  executive producer  "  do in a movie  .  if i remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie  .  you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player  .  unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies  "  starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major hollywood player  ,  it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch   protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat  .  likely  ?  as things progress ms davis  (  who has problems being able to string two sentences together  )  finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations  .  when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what i'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch  ?  exactly
0	this thing was bad .  really bad .  i mean ,  low budget can sometimes be very inspiring ,  but not this .  the story was so off-the-shelf ,  the alien's behaviour so illogical ,  the characters so clichéed .  i found nothing good in it .  and i did try . 
0	positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar .   while sanders was an excellent character actor ,  he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it .   it is absolutely beyond stupidity .  gene lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting .   sadly ,  george sanders and co-star carol landis committed suicide in real life .  after making a film as deplorable as this ,  it is not shocking .   the usual appealing signe hasso is really nothing here . 
1	a great idea :  11 stories about 11 september .  11 directors from different countries with different results .  ken loach talking about an immigrant  ( as usual )  is just brilliant  ( as usual )  .  the frenchman does a very good job also ,  while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise .  however ,  the israel film was a bit boring ,  and the mexican guy ,  well ,  he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant .  8/10
1	this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind ,  tsui hark .  it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chow's shaolin soccer .  from the moment the movie started , there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were  deplicted with superb style .  if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts  " geek "  ,  you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons .  there ,  comes a fine performance ( as always )  from ekin cheung who plays  " sky king "  .  he teams up with louis koo ( red )  who i was very impressed by his flexible  " wing "  which deflected incoming attacks .  the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way .  not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline .  many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just  " shoved in random bits of debrise "  and even describe as  " the legend of poo "  .  however ,  the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie .  others who are famarialy with  " wu xia "  movies will have a better appoach .  in due respect .  there can be one weakness that could be foreseen .  the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made . in spite of all this ,  its a must see . 
0	i have a high tolerance for the weird ,  but frankly some movies go way ,  way beyond weird--so far that they make your brain hurt .  this is such a film .  trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking drugs--it's that incomprehensible .   the film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat .  however ,  out of the blue ,  tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur--making me wonder if i am losing something in the translation .  however ,  even if this is so ,  why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever ,  defecation ,  puking ,  lighting animals on fire ,  etc .  .  all this really seemed random and pretty awful .  oddly ,  and i don't know why ,  some see this as a work of genius .  i just don't get that . 
0	gee ,  what a crappy movie this was !  i cannot understand what people find so scary about  " the grudge "  .  the director plays one trick  ( i'd have to admit a very good one ,  that is brought to life very stylized )  and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again .  as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie ,  but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute .  to conclude ,  i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with ,  that the so-called predecessor  " the ring "  was way scarier and that buying a ticket for  " the grudge "  is a waste of money . 
0	there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film :  major chick davis  ( pat o'brien )  .  o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier .  but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly .  in fact ,  he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military .  he's tough when he has to be ,  yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor ,  roles he perfected in other films .  his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves .  o'brien seems natural in the role ,  and plays it in fine fashion .  two things help this movie :  o'brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending . 
1	i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact .  while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one ,  its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode ,  along with the uncovering of the murderer .   the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless .  at one point ,  gordon ,  playing a famous writer ,  makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt .  columbo ,  making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime-solver .  this is one of the best of many great columbo installments . 
1	this is the movie i've seen more times than any other  ( i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released )  .  and every time i see it ,  it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me .  the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography .  this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover .  in the same league :  maratonci trce pocasni krug ,  balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu .  this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection . 
1	i'd always wanted david duchovney to go into the movie business ,  and finally he did ,  and he made me proud .  this movie lived up to what i had hoped for .  duchovney played his character very well ,  managing to remain consistent with something new ,  instead of playing the agent molder we are used to .  therefore ,  i give him extra credit for his role ,  also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character .  david was great ,  but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy hutton .  a brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie ,  because he never fails to surprise you .  he has weaknesses ,  and strengths ,  making the story all the more believable .  i also very much enjoyed the narration ,  it added to the story a good deal ,  and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time .  this movie also had a wounderfull score .  i recomend this for anyone who likes drama ,  and doesn't mind blood . 
0	i want to say the acting is bad ,  but i think it was the directing that made it so .  i never thought much of highlander  ( same director )  but that one could be blamed on the 80s .   this one however ,  has no excuses .  people get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him !  ?  those kind of mistakes ,  along with an unclear time line ,  weird battle tactics ,  sub-par cutting and poor visual effects ,  makes this one a sub-par film over all .   then like so many other have commented ,  all this american bullshit .  the german general being practically scared of his captured american private .  be prepared to swallow a lot of it ,  although in small doses .   to sum it up ,  a not horrible but still definitely sub-par war movie in all aspects . 
1	rob estes ,  josie bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them .   basically ,  rob and josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation .  they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder .  they ,  rob and josie ,  move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house .   rob builds furniture ,  i think ,  which is close enough to frank lambert's  ( patrick duffy )  construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal mockage .   josie is some sort of cookie-making queen ,  though it doesn't look like she makes any of the cookies .  not close enough to carol foster's  ( suzanne somers ) hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage ,  but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage .   unlike step by step ,  they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another's last names ,  or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together .   anyhow ,  there are eight kids ;  moira ,  sandy ,  jeff ,  lily ,  daisy ,  nathan ,  andrew l .  and andrew b .  i ,  personally ,  think they should've just called the younger andrew 'andy' .   there's a lot of product placement ,  particularly for soup at hand  ( which is disgusting )  and listerine pocket packs .  there are also some stupid ,  senseless moments .  it's also not a great film to promote happy families .   but ,  hey !  rob estes !  this concludes my review of 'step by step .  .  .  on some really bad drugs . ' watch it for rob estes and his pretty ! eyes .  there are some great pretty ! eyes shots . 
0	a childless couple  ( brooke adams ,  jeff hayenga )  go to a doctor  ( james karen )  to try to conceive .  it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby .  .  .   pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script--the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end .  i saw every  " twist "  coming .  the direction is poor--he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene .  the production values are--to be nice--lousy .  very shabby .  and ,  the gore scenes are too unpleasant  ( i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach )  with lousy special effects .  the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film .   some good acting makes it somewhat bearable .  adams ,  hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it .  this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown--it's easy to see why .  i give it a 4 . 
0	dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind ,  but now he's  " fixed .  "  lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one  ( goldblum )  ,  who's supposed to have something going with lane's sister  ( barkin )  .   with what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast  ( burt reynolds ,  gabriel byrne ,  kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor )  can't help this plot ,  as dreyfuss proves he's not  " fixed "  and tries to kill just about everyone in sight .   you know ,  it's not like you didn't know what was coming .  the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out ,  but i'll save you all the trouble :  skip this movie .   the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies .  the real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot ,  but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie  ( although we hear about her all through the movie )  .  even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film .  the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on .   3 out of 10 stars . 
0	is it just me or is that kid really annoying ?   hideos sister ,  spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so .  as for him ,  well ,  i know he's a kid n all ,  but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree .  so far i'm only half way through ,  and am fascinated by the story ,  but the people in it ,  let it down ,  i just hope it gets better by the end ,  as i can't not know what it's all about .  although ,  some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook ,  indicate everything is backwards ,  i . e .  dog is god ,  live is evil etc .  .  .  just seems a little obvious at the moment ,  yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning ,   ( as yet anyway )  if my opinion changes at the end of the movie ,  i'll update this post ,  but if your reading this ,  then well .  .  .  .  .  .  see above statement . 
1	having read diamond's book ,  i was slightly disappointed in the series ,  but all in all ,  it is quite informative .  reading the other comments ,  it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work ,  seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug .   is diamond a little preachy  ?  sure .  like a lot of academics ,  he sees his theory as the most important thing ever .  he uses the phrase 'guns ,  germs ,  and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series .  we get it ,  after about the first 10 minutes .   is diamond a little simplistic  ( in the series )   ?  sure .  the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing ,  condensing some very long ,  complicated history down to 'smallpox ,  swords ,  and horses' ,  wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes .  but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute  ( but not totally define )  the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures .   is he preaching *against* western civilization in any way  ?  nope .  not a word .  not to my ear .  all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly ,  *not* that luck is the only reason .   in the end ,  if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority ,  then this series is not for you .  but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail ,  this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence . 
0	ironic that dr .  seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped ,  marketed ,  and successful blockbusters of the holiday season .  the general gist of ron howard's adaptation is that the grinch's bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou who  ( played very well by taylor momsen )  .  this movie makes an ardent ,  ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss' story ,  but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones' animated version .  jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch ,  but whether it's the dialogue ,  the pacing ,  or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot ,  the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly .  there are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing ,  yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing .   succinctness ?   soul ?   or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long .  howard ,  carey ,  and crew are all very capable and talented ,  but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product .  if you must see the feature-length version ,  rent it on video with jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better .  i give this film three cans of who-hash out of five . 
1	john cassavetes'  " opening night "  is fantastic and fascinating ;  fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination ,  fascinating because it never ceases surprising us .  with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes ,  anyone who appreciates characters won't be able to take their eyes off the screen .   the story of an unstable actress ,  myrtle gordon ,   ( gena rowlands )  trying to put herself together for a play ,  fighting her demons ;   " opening night "  is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world .  all of cassavetes' characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater ;  so half of the film takes place on a stage ,  either where the performers do their job or at backstage ,  where producers and writers and directors do their job .   cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience ,  but the audience in the cinema .  because there is another audience ,  in the theater of the film ,  that doesn't know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance .  and that's essentially what it is ;  it's just that the audience in the theater doesn't get to see 'backstage' the way we do .  they don't experience gena rowlands' exuberance before she goes out to that stage ,  but most importantly ;  they don't know the reasons why she acts the way she does .   i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor .  myrtle  ( rowland )  says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do ;  and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer ,  it would be really difficult to tell when he's saying the truth because i would know he's an actor and he can fake anything at any time .  a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her throughwe suspect if she's being real ;  the rest of the characters suspect too .   there is the writer ,  sarah  ( joan blondell )  ,  who can't understand why myrtle doesn't understand the character she's written for her .  there's the director ,  manny  ( ben gazzara )  ,  who can't accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it ;  the producer david  ( paul stewart )  who doesn't know where to stand and myrtle's co-star maurice  ( cassavetes himself )  ,  who can't deal with the love they have for each other .   when she witnesses the death of a teenager ,  a fan ;  all of this comes together and affects myrtle ,  but no one knows if her delusions are for real .  they don't say anything because they don't want to upset her ,  but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts .  at times ,  we can tell that everyone has had it .  during these moments ,  cassavetes' brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage ;  and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them .   here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking ,  just like cassavetes' way of making cinema .  and in this aspect ,  the performances are more important here than in  " shadows "  ,  because the characters are involved in a bigger picture ;  a bigger story that steps out of the trivial .   but in another aspect ,  the actual way of making cinema ,  this movie is no different from  " shadows "  .  there's a beautiful thing in the way al ruban's camera shoots the characters .  when someone's talking ,  the camera doesn't focus on him ,  it shoots the person who is listening ;  so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one's saying .  sometimes they don't care ,  sometimes they are happy ,  sometimes devastated .   improvisation might still be there ,  though ,  among all these wonderful performances .  near the end ,  there's an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking ,  non-stop .  whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder .  we have just got to watch ;  and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it showsit doesn't get more natural than that . 
1	how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together .  josie bissett and rob estes  ( who are married in real life )  play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households  ( each has two boys and two girls ) into a cohesive family unit .  what transpires when the group ,  which includes four teenagers ,  two preteens and two younger children ,  makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim .  the fights between the kids  ( and one little love affair between two of them )  make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along .  more interesting than the brady bunch ,  what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours .  recommended as a feel good movie for all ages . 
0	if you are one of the people who finds  " according to jim "  great television comedy ,  this is going to rock your world .  and might i add ,  kudos for proving that good talent ,  good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc ,  which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year .    " k-911 "  is a big ,  steaming ,  brown ,  german shepherd-sized  " thank you "  for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie .  it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve .  jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard .  look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee .   if you enjoy jim's work ,  this movie is your reward . 
0	this movie is a mess ,  but at least it's not pretentious .  the box art for the video markets it as a  " fun throwback "  to 1950s giant bug movies .  in reality ,  it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of  " aliens "  .   the producers clearly wanted to make an  " alien "  picture ,  but they mustn't have had much money .  in fact ,  it doesn't look like they had any money ,  really .  i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing .   the basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons ,  i presume .  instead of setting the film in space ,  where no one can hear you scream ,  they set the film in a hospital ,  where everyone can see your budget laid bare .  the amusing thing about  " blue monkey "   ( and there is only one thing amusing about it )  is ,  the filmmakers didn't abandon the  " alien "  aesthetics .  even though we're in a hospital ,  we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted ,  in this case the venerable  " growth hormone "  plot device .  the annex also doubles as a boiler room  ( or something )  ,  so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth .  the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks ,  perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats .   the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location .  he touches it and says  " ow "  ,  so we know he's been hurt .  the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes ,  and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth  ( i guess in an  " alien "  picture this would be called the  " mouthburster "  ?  )  .  the worm is isolated ,  but some naughty little kids  ( leukemia patients )  sneak up on it and  " accidentally "  give it some experimental growth hormone .  you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane ,  and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons ,  right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms .  the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster ,  semi-obscured by the semi-darkness .   which brings us back to  " alien "  .  how ,  you ask ,  can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the  " alien "  movies ?  no problem .  .  . a power outage  ( or something )  causes the electrical system to go awry ,  which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie .  this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects  ( although the bugs are pretty neat looking ,  they don't move too well ,  and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy )  .   ok ,  so what  " alien "  bases haven't we covered .  .  . oh ,  water dripping down the walls !  check .  .  . we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts ,  then send some of the characters through the damp ,  drippy basement to get to the other side .  problem solved ,  we now have the opportunity for numerous  " foreboding tunnel "  shots .  and don't forget the fog .  .  . well ,  you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies ,  do you ?  ok ,  maybe inside of a hospital you do ,  so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn .   i haven't said anything about the negligible acting ,  not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow .  i take it  " blue monkey "  was supposed to be lighthearted and fun ,  and if so then it is a nice try ,  but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag .  see a film called  " return of the aliens :  the deadly spawn "  if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right ,  with even less money and even more marginal acting talent .  this one falls flat on its alien . 
1	i first rented this film many years ago ,  and was completely enthralled by it .  just recently ,  feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime ,  i decided to give  " erendira "  another look .  and i'm glad i did ,  as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film .   the story is about a teenaged girl  ( erendira ,  played remarkably by claudia o'hana - in some respects she resembles winona ryder !  )  who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother ,  played downright hypnotically by irene papas ,  forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages .    the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though ,  inspite of the basic premise ,  which deals with prostitution ,  is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content .  the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother ,  and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which ,  by the way ,  is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexico .   the film is very atmospheric ,  arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality .  it sometimes borders on the bizarre ,  but not to the point of ,  say ,  a david lynch film .  it's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature ,  read the comments from previous viewers below .  .  .   often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion ,  quiet and melancholy ,  adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting .  the cinematography of the rural places ,  many of which are in the desert ,  is quite superb .   the film moves at a nice pace ,  neither too fast nor too slow ,  and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again ,  just because it makes you want to do that .  for me anyway ,  it really is that compelling .   hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version ,  with subtitles .  i studied spanish in high school as well as in college ,  and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue .  por ejemplo :   " el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba .  "   (  " the world's not as big as i thought "  - i . e .  ,  it's a small world .  )   this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine ,  which ,  upon drinking ,  is immensely satisfying ,  however ,  you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one . 
1	somehow ,  this movie manages to be invigorating ,  bittersweet ,  and heartwarming at the same time .  stars like tony shalhoub  ( from providence )  bring the tale to life .  the story itself is inspiring .  we see a desperate ,  up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable :  a bird's .   paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl  ( played by hallie eisenberg ,  also known as the pepsi girl )  with a speech impediment .  while she learns to speak correctly ,  so does paulie .  however ,  unlike most birds ,  he can speak and understand everything being said .  the military father doesn't like the bird ,  so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist ,  ivy .  she teaches him manners ,  etc .  ,  while traveling across the country to find paulie's owner .  the movie continues with several twists of fate ,  until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement ,  and found by a russian custodian ,  who is touched by the bird's story .  the plot is in keeping with the simple ,  metaphorical theme that language is a gift ,  and a curse .  i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding .  a beautiful mixture of flute ,  digital base ,  and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy .  the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more .  and ,  as a final remark ,  the puppetry is entirely believable .   ( unlike in star wars ,  where yoda resembles a muppet )  this film is one of my favorite movies ,  with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently .  overall ,  i give this movie **** out of four stars ,  two thumbs up ,  and a big hug . 
0	i love horror films ,  low budget ,  50's ,  60's ,  70's ,  80's .  .  but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film ?  let's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films .  the haunting ,  the changeling ,  the shining .  or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better ,   ( though still far from great )  demon seed .  ok ,  i'll be fair .  .  let's compare it to made-for-tv horror films !  don't go to sleep .  .  waaay creepier and better done .  salem's lot ,  the night stalker ,  night gallery ,  even don't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better .  *spoilers* first of all ,  for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was ,  you have a scene like the opening scene .  .  oh boy !  the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers !  terrible .  also ,  just what we understand about the house .  .  it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on ,  and it's a very emotional house .  not a spirit ,  or demon ,  or entity ,  it's a house thats  " possessed "  ,  but by what ?  we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie/margaret ,  our protagonist ?  now that i'm on the topic of suzie .  .  another scene that totally bothered me ,  this poor old crazy lady comes ,  tells you she was your nurse ,  pours her heart out ,  falls in the boiling pool ,  struggling in agony for 45 seconds ,  and what does margaret do ?  does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her's life ?  no ,  she stands there and watches !  the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film ,  but that's where the positives end .  for at least a more interesting ,  and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed :  the bed that eats .  i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired ,  or remembered it scaring them as children .  this film was pretty much merit less . 
1	i watched this movie after watching practical magic ,  and the older film was far superior .  i liked the way the lighting ,  makeup ,  and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story .  jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film ,  but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character .  i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine .  the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me .  i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate ,  so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters . 
0	ok ,  the box looks promising .  whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting .  then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes .  supposed to be a comedy .  and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending .  this movie has the following elements :  a battered and abused next door neighbor ,  a boring legal trial ,  racisim ,  talk of lynchings ,  and death and arson .  hilarious ,  huh ?  no ,  please ,  if you never listen to anyone's reviews ,  please do here .  you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap .  crap !  i said it ,  crap !  whoever put there name on this should indeed sue . 
0	if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor ,  enough film for only one take of each shot ,  and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes ,  and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the french revolution ,  and also didn't have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds ,  and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn't make the auditions of that year's soap opera ,  and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film ,  and also the zoom function on the camera didn't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn't stop ,  oh and if i hated my audience ,  then i might make something kind of like this awful ,  yet mistakenly hilarious ,  hell-worthy waste of time .  the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas' latest creations ,  which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie ,  there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel/space laser battle .  i don't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it ,  but that's not how it ends .  the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review .  peace . 
1	reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting .  i even found a site which claimed that bette davis' success was probably due to her luck .  but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite .  the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart :  fog over frisco and on human bondage .  characters she played in these movies ,  though both being negative ,  are quite different .  arlene in the former is a beautiful ,  glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter ,  which is a pale ,  uneducated and impudent cockney waitress .  needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm .  but even that is not all .  the point is that the former role ,  which would be wished by most actresses of the day ,  was the one she was forced to play .  the latter role ,  which seemed to most actresses as undesirable ,  career destroying role ,  was the one she fought for ferociously for months .  and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars .  so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing .   the film ,  which tells about a medical student phillip carey  ( leslie howard )  which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers  ( bette davis )  ,  has a few week points ,  but many more strong ones .  the story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes .  for example ,  it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place .  well ,  there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes ,  but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved .  nevertheless ,  the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner's music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters' faces .  in fact the film is amalgamated by phillip's walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two-tone repetition .  every detail is well thought - max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillip's life ,  which is consistently used through the film .  and a beautiful scene in which we see sally's face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes i've ever seen exactly due to francis dee's breathtaking beauty  ( ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind )  as well as steiner's captivating music .  camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing .   but my strongest objection is that events are presented too two-dimensionally ,  which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut .  the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship ,  despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her ,  but they ,  curiously ,  finished portrayed as likable characters .  after all ,  mildred always - in her own specific ,  but still a honest way - lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him .  which he just refuses to hear .  it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem .  he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life .  of course ,  selfish and impudent mildred ,  after discovering voluntary phillip's bondage to her ,  did its own share to make his life hell .  even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen ,  it is less than clear why would she burn phillip's money  ( maugham intended different in his novel )  .  after all ,  she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne .   for modern standards the film is a bit outdated ,  but each subsequent time you watch it ,  you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting ,  fascinating music and original editing ,  so it does deserve the highest possible mark . 
1	jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs .  kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth .  even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth .  but this is a story that takes place in modern times ,  not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today .  jake's closet is about a boy ,  an only child ,  practically alone on summer vacation ,  dealing with his family falling apart .  it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense ,  a horror movie for the thinking person .  if you're looking for a slasher movie ,  this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting ,  this is the movie for you .  at the screening i saw ,  i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed .  i highly recommend catching this film . 
0	i'll be honest .  the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it's in the imdb bottom 100 .  and right now ,  i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on that same list .   van damme is luc deveraux ,  who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'hal' to defend itself .  and yes ,  after all the obligate explosions ,  shoot-outs and chases he is the last one standing .  combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set-up it makes sure it's place in the infamous list is just .   only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list .  2/10 . 
0	we should all congratulate uwe boll .  he's done the unthinkable .  he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb !  he's like some kind of cinematic cockroach .  no matter how little talent he has ,  and no matter how bad these movies are ,  he manages to keep making them .  i know ,  he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund ,  but even so ,  his ability to keep making movies despite absolute ,  complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe .   it wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy .  i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games .  even the latest one ,  the new nightmare ,  was good for a few hours of game play .  there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnby's adventures ,  but this is not it .  now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter :  the reckoning .  what's next ,  silent hill ?  doom ?  i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped .  someone needs to take away his line of credit ,  or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise ,  no one is interested in that title any more .   think about it ,  is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore ?  no way .  a new house of the dead game comes out for x-box and nobody's gonna care .  the title is dead ,  and all because of uwe boll .  so if any of you out there work for a game publisher ,  or know a game publisher ,  or have access to a game publisher .  .  .  please warn them .    this movie itself is not even worth reviewing .  i can't separate what i didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it .  literally ,  everything about it sucks .  the writing ,  the acting ,  the music ,  the cg effects ,  the editing .  i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations ,  i wouldn't be disappointed .  boy ,  was i wrong .  never underestimate uwe's ability to turn out a big ,  steaming pile of boll sh*t . 
0	just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit ,  i was a bit surprised it was even on .  there were so many goofs ,  mess-ups ,  and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch .  the acting was ok ,  but please ,  you can really feel the  " straight to video "  feeling .  the cast/crew made this movie a bad melodrama .  yes ,  there is a message in the movie ,  but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it .  trust me ,  you wouldn't even tell the difference . 
0	warning :  this review contains spoilers .  do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film .   with a cast like this ,  you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into .  did they see the script and say ,  `hey ,  close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can't fail . ' unfortunately ,  it does .  did they even think to check on the director's credentials ?  i mean ,  would you do a movie with the director of a movie called `satan's cheerleaders ? ' greydon clark ,  who would later go on to direct the infamous `final justice , ' made this .  it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer `final justice' and completely miss out on `the return . '  the film is set in a small town in new mexico .  a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam . er . a spaceship appears and hovers over them .  in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film ,  the ship spews some kind of red ink on them .  it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it ,  so right away you are treated with cheese .  anyhow ,  the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children .  elsewhere ,  we see vincent schiavelli ,  whom i find to be a terrific actor  ( watch his scenes in `ghost' for proof ,  as they are outstanding )  ,  who is playing a prospector ,  or as i called him ,  the miner 1949er .  he steps out of the cave he is in ,  and he and his dog are inked by the ship .  twenty-five years go by ,  and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd ,  who works with her father ,  raymond burr ,  in studying unusual weather phenomena .  or something like that .  shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town ,  and she travels there to research it .  once she gets there ,  the local ranchers harass her ,  and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on ,  and deputy jan-michael vincent comes to her rescue .  from this point on ,  the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other ,  especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier .  while this boring mess is happening ,  vincent schiavelli ,  with his killer dog at his side ,  is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item .  you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at halloween ,  the kind that you shake to make them glow ?  schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people .  it's the second-worst effect in the movie .  every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick ,  the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark ,  like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement .  it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is .   and what does all this lead up to ?  it's hard to tell when the final ,  confusing scene arrives .  see ,  burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of `calling card , ' but none of it makes sense .  why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not ?  schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead ,  but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it .  i mean ,  why doesn't he kill jan-michael vincent ?  after all ,  he had twenty-five years to do it .  and the aliens won't need him if shepherd is dead anyhow ,  so why try to kill her ?  speaking of the aliens ,  it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent .  what is their goal ?  why do they wait so long to intervene ?  how could they be so sure shepherd would come back ?  not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made `the return' any more pleasant .  you would still have bad lines ,  really bad acting ,  particularly by shepherd ,  cheesy effects ,  and poor direction .  luckily ,  the stars escaped from this movie .  cybill shepherd soon went on to star in `moonlighting' with bruce willis .  jan-michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b-movies ,  often in over-the-top parts .  raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death .  vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films .  martin landau ,  who played a kooky law enforcement officer ,  quickly made the terrific `alone in the dark' and the awful `the being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently .  you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to `the return . ' zantara's score :  2 out of 10 . 
0	if this guy can make a movie ,  then i sure as hell can make one too .   in fact ,  if you hire me to make a movie for you ,  i promise to do the following :   1 )  i will add more naked women .  this movie had none .  i think cheesy b-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body .  i wouldn't want to let my viewers down .   2 )  i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream .  i think horrorvision had about 4 of these scenes .  and ,  considering the movie was only like an hour long ,  the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high .  and ,  if i do decide to do a dream sequence ,  i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on .  i mean ,  who sleeps in leather pants ?  ?   3 )  i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine .    4 )  and finally ,  i will not mix modern technology with the undead .  i mean ,  a palm pilot can only be so scary  .  .  .  at least they turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen blew up or something .   so ,  if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production ,  count on me :  wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire . 
0	attack force has a horrendous title ,  and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover ,  because the film is horrible !  a mish-mash of plot lines ,  a choppy mess ,  and a horribly stagnated pace ,  make the film hard to watch start to finish .  i managed this and i'm proud .  as a fan of seagal's work  ( mostly of his old days )  ,  it's painful to see him star in such tripe .  true seagal's last half dozen movies or so ,  have sucked a lot ,  but some of them at least had some redeeming features .  attack force is a mess .  from conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes ,  from an alien plot line ,  to the current one about a highly addictive super drug ,  about to be unleashed on the romanian  ( the film has several settings ,  none of which are romanian ,  but all look like romania because they are in romania !  )  populace .  the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was .  plot-holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure .  that's been a problem in seagal's last few films as well ,  but never has the result been so boring .  there's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with ctx  ( that's the drugs cool name )  that is never resolved !    of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments ,  especially the action .  before i regard the action though ,  all the other departments are poor .  the direction is poor ,  or perhaps better put ,  made to look poor .  who knows how director michael keusch originally intended this film ?  between him finishing his job ,  the re-shoots by stunt man tom delmar ,  and the editing ,  a coherent auteur vision is completely lost .  the best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop !  the cinematography is dull ,  nearly inducing sleep ,  while the droning score  ( sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers )  does nothing to excite matters .  the cast too are poor ,  unable to salvage anything here .  seagal looks bored beyond recognition ,  and is dubbed through much of the picture ,  clearly when plot-points are being changed .  he looks tired and overweight ,  and lethargic ,  unlike he's looked in previous pictures too  ( remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in seagal's recent pictures )  .  the only redeemable cast member is adam croasdell as one of the villains ,  doing a slimy brit routine .  he seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line ,  because he's playing it inhuman .  he seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire  ( ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion ,  seemingly waiting for her husband dracula )  .   finally the action .  well it's poor .  poorly conceived ,  poorly shot .  there's not much either ,  and there's even less featuring seagal .  stevo doesn't really bring out the stunt double here ,  because there's so little to do .  there's even a lengthy  ( repetitive and boring )  action scene on the hour mark that inter-cuts occasionally with little flashes of seagal's stand in because clearly seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot ,  and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene .  seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head .  seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit ,  but from what i understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in .  seagal will apparently not be working with these people again ,  or with castel studio's who continue to deliver horrifically sub-nu-image  ( that's saying something )  ,  material .   overall this is one to avoid if you are not a seagal fan .  seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again .  unfortunately his next film which has already been shot ,  with the same people ,  promises to be even worse than this .  *
1	those who know who know the kelly  " legend "  & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film  ( eg .  naomi watt's character never existed in reality )  ,  but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment ,  it holds up pretty well .  ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid ,  taking the mantle of cinema's best ned  ( not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious ,  mick jagger & former carlton champion  ( australian rules football )  bob chitty ,  a great footballer but a poor actor .  some location shooting film in the area i live ,  bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat . 
1	overall ,  i thought it a very nice movie - i hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong .  what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings ,  all gilded and shiny ,  this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good ,  strong writing  ( thank you julian fellowes  : d )  ;  nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp ,  i . e not sensationalised greatly  ( when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen ,  well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown )  .  it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth .   undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert ,  though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it ,  was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged  ( my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind ;  so much said without any words ,  that's what film is all about )  .  blunt held her own beautifully as well ,  she has a face that demands your attention and i can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous .  if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them !  the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well ,  harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight .   the only qualm i have ,  is that it lacked a sense of urgency ,  or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting ?   ( it was rather tame )  i don't know ,  i wanted 'something' to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more .  when she and albert argued ,  i loved it ,  i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments ,  though that may be just me .   lastly ,  at the risk of sounding all patriotic ,  it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position ,  especially in one so young .  this may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of victoria's young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in 'the sword & the scion' but nevertheless ,  it did flag up those feelings  ( for those following my book ,  can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects ?  )  it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation ,  which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain .  it made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then i suppose .   blog on films and books :  http : //sempergratis . blogspot . com
1	this is an extremely long movie ,  which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting ,  but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies .   if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching ,  because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak .  if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym ,  the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country ,  his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people .   there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story ,  not one loyal ,  'moral' personality to sympathise with .  but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable .   i really enjoyed it in the end .  well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character . 
0	i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie ,  but neither was i expecting it to be so awful .  i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel .  i turned it back ,  hoping it was just one part of the movie ,  but no .  and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed ,  or almost done out of a job ,  or driven to madness inside her own home ?  are you kidding me ?  i was raised to respect  ( and even fear )  my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house .  i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house ,  after all .   i didn't buy any of it .  i tried giving it several chances ,  i really did .  sorry . 
1	an old saying goes  " if you think you have problems ,  visit a hospital .  "  that has been updated in recent years to  " if you think you have problems ,  watch a tv talk show .  .  . especially jerry springer's !  "  this movie is one of those that is so bad ,  it's good !  that's why i gave it a seven-it's all right ,  but not great .  it's a great way to waste 95 minutes ,  just as the daily talk show is advertised as  " an hour of your life you'll never get back !  "  all the familiar themes are here .  .  . unfaithful husbands/boyfriends ,  the wildest audience on television ,  women flashing jerry ,  etc .  the shocker was watching molly hagan ,  who normally plays sweet characters  (  " seinfeld "  and  " herman's head "  )  playing a trailer-trash mom and jaime pressly  (  " my name is earl "  )  as her equally trashy daughter ,  performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact .  the men  ( including the staff producer )  were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got .  i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show .  here in phoenix ,  it's shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and ,  after that ,  everything else seems to pale .  again ,  i give this movie a seven .  .  . it's good but not great .  jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses . 
1	i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has .  i found the entire series on mysoju . com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see .  i wasn't disappointed in what i saw ;  i was moved .  this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes .  sumire iwaya ,  played thoughtfully by koyuki ,  shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown .  no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate .  so instead she substitutes a human ,  played by an adorable matsumoto jun ,  as a pet .  this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet .  the difference ;  he can retaliate in the same way ,  after all momo is a man ,  not a dog .  as he is treated like a pet ,  he reacts to situations how a dog might react .  she spends time with the new boyfriend ,  momo gets jealous .  it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - momo is a dance prodigy .  her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts .  matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning ,  to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer ,  to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man ,  not as a dog .  in my opinion ,  it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop .  plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too .  neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change ,  but as momo  ( the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy )  states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last .  watch this show with a open mind ,  it's worth it . 
0	i was interested in seeing this movie because i knew it was christian based .  the director had a good idea/intentions when making this movie but it could have been better .  i can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life .  however ,  i didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive ,  mean and rude .  the main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him .  they weren't understanding at all and they used god as a reason to explain their behaviors .  the main character ,  nor anyone else didn't know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced ,  still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with .  his friends were suppose to be christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not .  so many times we do things in life where we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him .  the ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend ,  when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name ,  address and phone number .  .  . she seemed to be the stalker !  .  she didn't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself .  god is love .  .  . and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god doesn't care about true love .  .  . only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with .  we all make mistakes .  .  . it's all about what steps you take to make amends .  like i said the movie had potential but i was tired of the one-sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so-called .  .  . well-meaning friends .  this movie didn't hold true to the christian belief of love but i give it a c for its effort . 
1	show favorites green arrow  ( introduced this season )  ,  aquaman  ( introduced in season 5 )  ,   " impulse "   ( season 4 )  ,  and cyborg  ( season 5 )  all come together ,  along with clark ,  to stop one of lex's evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode .   through his sophisticated technology ,  green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on .  green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry  ( aqua )  ,  bart allen  ( impulse )  and victor stone  ( cyborg )  to stop lex and destroy these facilities .  after recruiting clark to help ,  the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory .   this episode is incredible .  full of action ,  humor ,  and fabulous dialog ,  it feels more like a movie .  it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season . 
0	but i got over it .  to me ,  it seemed that even the author of the book favored caroline .  i felt so sorry for the character louise ,  and she was constantly compared with esau who was evil ,  i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un-realistic .  really though ,  the movie was bad .  i wouldn't really see it unless you're ready for a big let down . 
1	this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire-rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals .  as usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play ,  shore leave ,  that also served as the basis for a broadway musical ,  hit the deck .  anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters ,  as always ,  is the music ,  lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle .  it's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 )  we get to see astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs ,  one of which ,  i'm building up to an awful let-down ,  had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman ,  albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts .  he gets to perform a little-known but excellent berlin number ,  i'd rather lead a band as well as duetting on i'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt - let's face the music and dance ,  one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team .  so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire ;  we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is ,  do they deliver .  answer :  in spades . 
1	i saw 'new york :  i love you' today and loved it !  i was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'paris je t'aime' and overall i think i liked this one much better .  .  .  perhaps i need to watch 'paris je t'aime' again i don't know .  .  .  i read few of the reviews here about ny : ily and yes ,  the movie is not without its faults .  when you're paying tribute to a city like new york - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice .  .  .  so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings ,  i'll just write about what i liked .   unlike 'paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled ,  ny : ily isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing .  i thought otherwise .  i loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and i especially liked the overlapping of characters - it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now .  but i still liked it because i didn't find it forced .  and the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful ,  even whimsical quality to it - which some might find corny but i find beautiful .   i liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by yvan attal with robin wright penn and chris cooper .  it was so well-acted and scripted that the reveal in the end - again not unused in the past - brought me to tears and i was crying throughout the segment that followed .  i always liked wright penn and now i'm also a fan of chris cooper .  those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant ,  just before he gets the call - speak volumes about cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything .   most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4-5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time .  it seemed to me  ( and i might be wrong )  that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point ,  the need even ,  to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time ;  to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time .   the other films that i liked were the ones by shunji iwai with orlando bloom and christina ricci ,  by natalie portman with carlos acosta and taylor geare ,  by brett ratner with anton yelchin and olivia thirlby ,  by shekhar kapur with julie christie ,  shia labeouf and john hurt and once again the one by yvan attal with ethan hawke and emilie ohana when they're in the café .  i really need to see more work by yvan attal as i seem to like him a lot !    overall ,  watch this movie with an open mind .  don't read the reviews before watching it !  it might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in new york should be and i doubt any movie will really live up to that conception .  just watch this movie for some good music ,  beautiful landscape cinematography ,  some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings . 
1	if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes'ka-den ,  it was making it with the partnership he formed with the  " four knights "   ( the other three being kobayaski ,  ichikawa ,  and konishita )  .  they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership ,  and instead kurosawa ,  arguably the head cheese of the group ,  delivered an abstract ,  humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies .  had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows ,  but it was because of this ,  among some other financial and creative woes ,  that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 .  and yet ,  at the end of the day ,  as an artist kurosawa didn't stop delivering what he's infamous for with his dramas :  the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity .  that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored ,  but it's not at all a fault of kurosawa's .   the material in dodes'ka-den is absorbing ,  but not in ways that one usually finds from the director ,  and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot .  there's things that happen to these people ,  and kurosawa's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole .  the character who starts off in the picture ,  oddly enough  ( though thankfully as there's not much room for him to grow )  ,  is rokkuchan ,  a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds  ( the 'clickety-clack' of the title )  ,  only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother .  but then we branch off :  there's the father and son ,  the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house ;  an older man has the look of death to him ,  and we learn later on he's lost a lot more than he'll tell most people ,  including a woman who has a past with him ;  a shy ,  quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father  ( or uncle ,  i'm not sure )  ,  who rapes her ;  and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around .   there are also little markers of people around these characters ,  like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night ,  like clockwork ,  putting big demands on their spouses ,  sometimes  ( unintentionally )  swapping them !  and there's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman .  and of course there's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum ,  not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with a guy .  first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture ;  it's a little post-apocalyptic ,  looking not of any particular time or place  ( that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets )  .  it's a marginalized society ,  but the concerns of these people are ,  however in tragic scope ,  meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force .  like bergman ,  kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people ,  with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow ,  sorrowful eyes ,  sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it .   sometimes there's charm ,  and even some laughs ,  to be had with these people .  i even enjoyed ,  maybe ironically ,  the little moments with rokkuchan  ( specifically with kurosawa's cameo as a painter in the street )  ,  or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics .  but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise ,  his camera movements still remain as they've always been- patient but alert ,  with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots ,  painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper .  amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories ,  with some of them  ( i . e .  the father and son in the car )  especially sad ,  kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it's one of his paintings .  lush ,  sprawling ,  spilling at times over the seams but always with some control ,  this place is not necessarily  " lighter "  ;  it's like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene ,  where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath .  it's a brilliant ,  tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama .   with a sweet 'movie' score toru takemitsu  ( also responsible for ran )  ,  and some excellent performances from the actors ,  and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career ,  dodes'ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director ,  but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms ,  which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality . 
0	i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered .  the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through .   the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line ,  just one scene ,  that is even worth a chuckle .   she is a much better singer than i remember her to be ,  but i didn't want to watch a lounge act .   i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively . 
1	saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene .  a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars .  only wish i could find it again !  would certainly buy/view it if i could .  please ,  somebody ,  bring it back .  fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii ,  and his leading ladies ,  joan leslie ,  and especially june haver were beautiful and charming .  it was a musical ,  but also romantic ,  funny ,  and clever .  this was my favorite movie starring june haver ,  although i always liked her .  her dazzling smile lit up the screen ,  and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film .  the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles .  a well-balanced and light-hearted film ;  only wish we had more like it ! 
0	 " tapeheads "  ,  a scrappy ,  intermittently funny spoof of the music video business ,  might have been the perfect comedic short ,  and stars john cusack and tim robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved .  they play two semi-savvy security guards in los angeles who start their own company ,  video aces ,  making hilarious videos for groups ,  parties ,  and one deathbed star .  it's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time  ( shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength ,  sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s )  .  still ,  cusack and robbins create a couple of originals here :  nerdy but loose ,  street-smart without being hipsters or posers ,  these guys are on the same nutty wavelength ,  and they never put each other down .  they're the real thing in buddy-comedies .  *1/2 from ****
1	never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors .  in the period that this film was made ,  people in america were different ,  there was no tv or all the modern things we have today ,  except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood .  sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today .  ann shirley ,  " murder my sweet "  , '44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks ,  who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley .  it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened ,  the entire town found out about it within minutes .  it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living .  today ,  it seems very corn ball and stupid ,  but believe me ,  this was the way people were in america during the 1920' .  & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films . 
1	i just watched the documentary  " fog city mavericks "  on the starz cable tv network .  it is without a doubt ,  one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever !  it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made .  in addition to the well-known artists listed ,  t also includes segments with irvin kershner ,  caleb deschanel and a segment about pixar animation studios .  i hope it will be released on dvd-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making .  if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them ,  you will not be disappointed . 
1	a very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of gm's flint ,  michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us .  set in western pennsylvania ,  it features great performances by michael keaton ,  gedde watanabe ,  and george wendt .  music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan . 
0	i can't understand all the hype about this movie .  ok ,  if you like cheap splatter ,  you will love this movie ,  but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this .  personally i really disliked the actors in this movie ,  they seem to be hired straight from the street .  the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next .  the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget .  when we saw this movie  ( me and 3 other people )  we all had in mind ,  that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this ,  just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort .  another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam  ( very shaking )  and the bad sound ,  the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone . 
0	please ,  be warned :  this movie ,  though a pretty bad storyline ,  was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen .  .  . ever .  just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie .   so ,  it officially begins with a party .  just your average party but there's some guy there .  he's pretty into kate .  .  . if you know what i'm saying .  memorise his face ;  it'll help later .   so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney  ( didn't i say the plot was bad ?  )  and so takes the tube .  that's london underground at the middle of the night ,  but she's just stupid like that .  so the timetable says the next ,  and last ,  train will come in 7 minutes .  now kate ,  dumb party girl that she is ,  decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes .  typically ,  she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground .  alone .  well ,  almost .  .  .   so the movie just carries on from there .  blood ,  guts ,  limbs ,  even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body .   in short ,  it's a typical horror ;  pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick ,  weird psycho .  or as the case may have it ,  creep .   i'd say give it a go if you're into saw ,  hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us ,  scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much . 
0	i recently viewed manufactured landscapes at the seattle international film festival .  i was drawn to the movie as a photographer because i'm both familiar and a fan of burtynsky's work .  while i believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across ,  i couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by burtynsky .  obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them .  while this is a good effect when used economically ,  i felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from burtynsky's book  ( which i already own )  .  that's probably an exaggeration ,  but that's how i felt .  if you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one . 
1	if the movies are to be believed ,  chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts .  the storylines of the three 'chinese ghost' films are largely identical ,  but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem .  as always ,  humour is an integral part of the film ,  accompanied ,  of course ,  by a great deal of mugging .  for those who haven't encountered the 'chinese ghoststory' trilogy yet ,  this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror/ghost genre ;  for those who have ,  another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world . 
1	if you think  " weird al "  yankovic is hilarious ,  you won't be disappointed by the compleat al .  not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of yankovic's more memorable videos  (  " like a surgeon "  and  " i love rocky road "  among them )  ,  but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame .  yankovic is not for all tastes ,  but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused .  die-hard fans will love it not only for its content ,  but also for its relatively early look into yankovic's now nearly three decade career .  suitable for all ages ,  kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals . 
0	i just saw dreamgirls yesterday ,  and i was really underimpressed .  despite all the oscar buzz ,  this is nothing special .  anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics .  except for eddie murphy's great musical and dramatic performance ,  dreamgirls is just a glorified tv movie with no style or flair .  just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other !   now ,  the first half hour was good ,  but i was irritated at how eddie murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages .  those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film .  and the  " rise to the top "  portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum .  the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless ,  rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting .  it was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes .   condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i'd expected they would .  each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people  " singing "  at each other .  and the way they shot hudson's big  " love me "  number was criminal !  condon just shot her stomping around the stage--no drama at all !  god it sucked !   and note to all involved--that  " sing-talking dialog "  stuff might work on stage ,  but it does not work in movies  ( see embarrassing failures of evita and phantom )  .  all that  " i'll teeeell youuuu something efff-ieeee !  "  crap should have been left on the editing room floor .  those aren't  " songs .  "   again ,  the film--except for eddie murphy's amazing performance--was nothing more than a glorified tv movie .  there must have been megabucks behind the pr work for this film !  i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release  " one to beat "  oscar buzz ?  as a whole this film was ,  except for eddie ,  nowhere near an oscar caliber movie !   ( except for eddie )  i'd rank it right up there with grease 2 .  big disappointment ,  especially after all the  ( very expen$i've )  hype ! 
0	well ,  it was funny in spots .  this film is a 4 or maybe a 3 .  its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust .  rent this one after you seen everything else .  beats boredom ,  but not by that much .  my wife like like this film better then i do ,  maybe its not that bad . 
0	rodney dangerfield is a great .  he has done a lot of great works .  but this one .  .  .  . is awful .  the whole plot is whack .  it could have been much better .  the jokes in the movie aren't funny .  .  .  . their stupid .  this was very not so hilarious .  he can do much better than this . 
0	this movie was so bad i don't know whether to laugh or cry .  i had high hopes for horrorfest that year ,  which was also the first year i attended horrorfest ,  and i have to say horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level .  mad kudos to the advertisers because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year .  the hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen  ( the other ones i saw were unrest ,  dark ride ,  and reincarnation )  .  the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot ,  only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire .  which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film .  and to make the plot even more ridiculous ,  they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a 'bite' out of one another ,  and some deadly creature locked in the basement ,  which if i had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film ,  i would have left the theater halfway into the movie .   complete waste of money and time .  cut forty minutes out of this film ,  and make it into an episode on some show like smallville or charmed or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this .  absolute rubbish !  so bad that two years later ,  i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  also ,  while you're reading this ,  steer clear from the rest of the horrorfest movies in the future .  the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere .  horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen ,  and all the crap about 'stuff they don't show you in theaters' ,  they weren't referring to blood or guts ,  or horror .  .  . they were referring to the movies themselves .  because they're horrendous .  think of horrorfest as a less renowned version of sundance film festival ,  but for horror movies .   sorry for all the 'hate' ,  but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money . 
0	i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it .  it was one of worst movies i've ever seen .  i'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie ,  i would probably never talk to them again .  anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry ,  hermit type personality .  i'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too ,  just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie .  i know everyone has different types of humor ,  some people may not even like mine ,  but that's okay ;  i don't think this covers any range of humor though .  this movie is as flat and dull as wes anderson's mind .  go in and get ready to walk out ;  it's best to get your money back too . 
1	the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast .  a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it .  but this movie caught me off guard .  it wasn't what i was expecting at all .  it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing !  !  !  and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me .  the script was amazingly written .  every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen .  there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious .  the cinematography ,  along with the set ,  was absolutely beautiful as well .  i really can't say anything bad about this movie !  expcept ,  i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time ! 
0	the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters .  the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times .   it may sound weak and cliché but it's true ;  you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin .  it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is .  i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure .  for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors ,  not even when they play themselves !  their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long ,  distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times .   the movie had quite some potential ,  i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch ,  so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was ;  brilliant !  the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters .  the movie does has a certain entertainment value ,  at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still ,  i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie .   watching this movie felt like a waste of time .  still this movie might be watchable just once ,  when it gets on tv ,  on a rainy afternoon .  it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential .   4/10
1	hey people ,  what's up .  it's me man ,  the one and only mike  " sonny sakura killer "  kelly .  you know .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  you can't really write a review on the script of sakura ,  cause there we didn't have one .  as far as i know ,  the story was just made up as we went along .  i had the best time of my life making that film ,  and got so much stank that i ran out of jism .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . fun times .  so glad that you all enjoyed the film .  i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned .  every time i set up some moves ,  the fight director kept changing them .  still ,  i had a blast and met some really great people .  especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film-making scene . 
1	considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films ,  i have no argument with that ,  although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining .  one thing :  it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes .  i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long .   nonetheless ,  it is a good mixture of action ,  suspense and romance .  the only things missing are color and stereo sound .  the primitive special-effects don't bother me ,  as that was all that they had back in the 1930s .   among some ,  this film is most noted for one thing :  skin !   " jane "  never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made .  her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed .  the nude underwater scene ,  however ,  was not her - by a longshot .  the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all ,  whoever it was .   there is plenty of action in here .  up to the finale ,  it was not overdone ,  either .  the ending went on for 15 minutes ,  though ,  and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch .   still ,  this movie offers about everything - except  " boy "   ( their adopted son )  - you'd want to see in a tarzan film ,  even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times .  with her pair of  " lungs ,  "  that was no problem . 
1	i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981 !  i have lost track of how many times i have seen it !  it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down .  the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless ,  plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song ?  i think i quote this movie without realizing it .  i basically know the entire script ,  so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it .  i can't even narrow it down ,  although ,  sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones .  the famous  " i'll alert the media "  when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless ,  but the list is truly endless .  the scene's at arthur's soon to be fiancé's father's house are a scream ,  particularly his interactions with the moose .  do yourself a favour and see this movie ! 
0	i can't quite say that  " jerry springer : ringmaster "  is the worst film i have ever seen .  the film would be better off if it were ,  because at least the worst film i've ever seen ,   ( prom night ii )  interested me enough for me to hate it .  my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed .  it had seemed much more like years .  it is an endless repetition of poor people ,   ( or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are )  ,  screwing each other ,  hitting each other ,  insulting each other ,  and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing .  the plot ,  which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill ,  advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters .  this makes it impossible to care what happens to them .  it never mattered to me whether they got on the show ,  or what they said ,  or who slept with whom .  maybe i'm not supposed to care about them .  maybe i'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny .  too bad it isn't .  the humor is not outrageous .  it's innocuous .  it's predictable .  humor has to have something behind it ,  some kind of painful irony or life experience ,  in order to function .  scatology is not wit .  an example .  a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed .  to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter's boyfriend .  since i was over the shock of jerry springer's show a long time ago ,  i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay's obscene nursery rhymes ;  not laughter ,  just yawning .  lastly ,  i found springer's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing .  if he really were an advocate of the poor ,  he would bring on a single mom from bed-sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on $12 , 000 a year .  or ,  failing that ,  he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits .  jerry springer gets millions for his shows ,  his movie ,  his book and videos .  his guests just get round trip air fare ,  hotel accommodations ,  and a chance to humiliate themselves .  if he liked poor people so much ,  he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him .  it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself .  jeez ,  with all his fine work ,  you'd think he'd have earned our respect already .  anyway ,  the film is weak and boring .  it doesn't even succeed at being offensive .  if you want to have a better evening ,  videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that . 
1	this is what i call a  " pre sci fi ;  sci fi "  movie .  it gets no better than lugosi/karloff in this incredibly good  " mood "  type motion picture .  these two genuine artists are at their very best ,  as is the story line .   karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity ,  pride ,  and scientific competition .  i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts .  i was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in .    this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake .  this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe kieffer sutherland as the bela lagosi role .  it might be possible to do it almost as good .   this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced .  as i said .  . it gets no better .  no way . 
0	 " national treasure "   ( 2004 )  is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written .  the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates  ( how precious is that ,  i ask you ?  )  ;  a seemingly normal fellow who ,  for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters ,  decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the united states founding fathers .  after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably  ( unintentionally )  like indiana jones meets the patriot ,  the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a 'stanley goodspeed' regurgitation of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane ,  but disconnected misadventures .   the relevancy and logic to having george washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil ,  and then ,  going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout u . s .  currency art work ,  is something that director jon turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining .  couldn't washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country ?  hence ,  we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth .  ben's intentions are noble  if confusing .  he's set on protecting the treasure .  for who and when ? your guess is as good as mine .   but there are a few problems with ben's crusade .  first up ,  his friend ,  ian holmes  ( sean bean )  decides that he can't wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the declaration of independence from the national archives  ( oh ,  yeah  brilliant idea !  )  .  presumably ,  the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune .  so ian tries to kill ben .  the assassination attempt is ,  of course ,  unsuccessful ,  if overly melodramatic .  it also affords ben the opportunity to pick up ,  and pick on ,  the very sultry curator of the archives ,  abigail chase  ( diane kruger )  .  she thinks ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning .  but true to action/romance form ,  abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say ,   " is that the hope diamond ?  "  the film moves into full x-file-ish mode ,  as the fbi ,  mistakenly believing that ben is behind the theft ,  retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive .  honestly ,  don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct ?  in the final analysis ,   " national treasure "  isn't great film making ,  so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies ,  woven together from scraps ,  the likes of which would make il' betsy ross blush .   the buena vista dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of .  the anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors ,  natural flesh tones ,  solid blacks and clean whites .  the stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements .  the audio is 5 . 1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism .  extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made .  if only ,  as an audience ,  we had had more clarification as to why ben and co .  were chasing after an illusive treasure ,  this might have been one good flick .  extras conclude with the theatrical trailer ,  audio commentary and deleted scenes .  not for the faint-hearted  just the thick-headed . 
0	before i'd seen this ,  i had seen some pretty bad christmas films .  but once i saw this ,   " jingle all the way "  looked better than  " the godfather "  .   " santa claus "  is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids ,  but it almost feels demonic watching it .  santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil ,  devilish laugh that i'm sure has turned many kids off of christmas .  the plot of this massacre is very strange ,  which fits along with all of the performances and dialog .  santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he ,  and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas .  but santa has an enemy named pitch ,  or satan .  pitch tries to ruin santa's christmas by making three boys naughty ,  and by creating diversions ,  like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot .  when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog ,  it's up to santa's helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle .    everything about this film ,  along with being downright bad ,  is so bizarre .  satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa .  santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls ,  yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico .  the reindeer are wind up toys ,  and when the reindeer laughs ,  i'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes .  .  . it's frightening .  everything is terrible .  the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it .  probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain .  i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from ,  than showing them this .  the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema .   my rating :  bomb/**** .  85 mins . 
1	i've read one comment which labeled this film  " trash "  and  " a waste  of time .  "  i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit  too much .   i just rented the new criterion dvd's of both yellow and blue .   these films--although hardly great--have at least become of  historical interest as to the so-called  " radical student  political-social movement " of the late '60s .   i hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation ,  i  was expecting some real porn  ( there isn't any .  )  there is frontal  nudity  ( including the still verboten frontal male nudity  ( automatic  nc-17--the orwellian-x )  in the u . s .  but i wasn't expecting the films  in-your-face democratic socialist message .    though it tends to the simplistic  ,  i thought it occassionally made  its points well .  both films occassionally had me laughing out loud  and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of  parody in the film .  especially the supposedly  " pornographic "  sex  scenes .  the first such scene is very realistic .  the lead couple is  clumsy ,  inept ,  funny and endearing in their first copulation scene .   the second--which caused the most complaints--has faked  cunnilingus and fellatio .  and the last is the end of an angry fight ,   that is believable .   the extras include an informative introduction to the film ,  an  interview with the original american distributor and his attorney ,   excerpts from trial testimony in the u . s .  and a  " diary "  commentary  by the director on some scenes .   this is the film that  " blue noses "  wouldn't let alone and led to the  pivotal  " prurient interest with no social redeeming value "  standard  that ,  thankfully ,  still stands .   those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must  see . 
0	what was franco zeffirelli thinking ?  was hollywood responsible for this travesty ,  or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte's classic ?  i don't think i can improve on a comment i read below ,  so i'll just paraphrase it :   " jane eyre is a great great book ,  the screenwriter should read it sometime .  "  it's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast .  but pity the actors ,  because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes .  the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun .  .  . deleted from the script .  the marriage proposal ,  the fortune teller .  .  . gone .  the allusions ,  half joking ,  half sincerely felt ,  to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair .  .  . eliminated .   it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane's interactions with the rivers family .  but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written .   do yourself a favor and go find the 1983  (  ?  )  mini series with timothy dalton . 
1	i thoroughly enjoyed this flick .  i am of the firm belief that matt stone and trey parker are comic geniuses of our time .  they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way  .  .  . if that makes any sense .  this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny .  once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever ,  you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed .  that is apparent in baseketball .  although it is directed by david zucker and is utterly rediculous ,  it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports .  i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love .  the opening prologue is brilliant .  .  . tears from laughter form everytime i see those football players begin riverdance !  some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea .  .  . but ,  just like south park ,  once you look past the absurdity .  .  . it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius .  i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars . 
1	this is a great movie .  i love it more each time i watch .  most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags ,  but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo ,  or hank azaria says good-bye to louise lasser ,  or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography ,  or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report ,  or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens -- is a pleasure .  this is pitch perfect ensemble acting .  the story develops directly and consistently ,  the action sequences are creative and not too dominant ,  all the set-ups payoff by the end .  seriously ,  if you've seen it and it's been a while ,  watch it again ,  and if you haven't then get started .  you can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time .   ( wes studi ,  william h .  macy ,  the tryouts scene .  too much good stuff !  ) 
1	most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid- and some of them ,  the blob included ,  scared the daylights outta me .  movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us  " small fry "  that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld ;  the blob just reiterated that fact .  i recall ,  fondly ,  late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society .  there was a summer ,  in the early 1980s ,  when a local science museum  ( in richmond ,  virginia )  ran an atomic age classic every weekend .  these were 16mm films ,  and most were black and white  ( and the projector was noisy )  ,  and the  " color "  print of the blob had faded to a faint pink- but ,  man ,  was it fun .  i dragged my mother along ,  and she enjoyed it as much as i did .  it was there ,  at that science museum ,  that i truly fell in love with the blob .  the filmmaker's intent was ,  of course ,  to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved ,  from the filmmakers to the  " talent "   ( the players )  ,  that made me fall in love with this movie .  corny ?  you bet .  cheesy ?  they don't get any cheesier .  but ,  man ,  what a movie ! 
0	the fiendish plot of dr .  fu manchu starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by sax rohmer is an injustice to the end of sellers' career .  the plot was very simplistic ,  and if done the right way could have been handled nicely ,  but instead it was poorly executed .  part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog ,  cheap laughs ,  choppy directing ,  and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete .   the acting ,  on the other hand ,  was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture .  i found sellers portrayal of diabolical manchu brilliantly done ,  with the occasional lines that will be remembered .  for example ,  there is the scene where fu manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says  " ah ,  you all look the same to me .  "  i hate to admit it ,  but i laughed out loud with that line .   then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen mirren as the backstabbing constable ,  david tomilson as sir roger avery  ( his last film as well ,  not a way to end a career )  ,  and sid ceasar  ( who gives a rather whimsical performance of al capone's relative who works for the fbi )  .  these characters also kept me watching .   the sets were also nice .  oriental designs and english society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture .   in all honesty ,  my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid ceasar fan .  otherwise ,  you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil . 
0	i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie .  i can just see the movie execs sitting around going ,   " okay ,  we need to come up with something that's just like home alone ,  only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid ,  hire cut-rate actors ,  and oh yeah ,  we'll make it a lot less funny !  "   okay ,  maybe not the last part ,  but that's basically what you've got here .  not even worth seeing if someone else rents it .  and as a movie for kids ?  forget it .  i wouldn't let my kids see this ,  not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes ,  but because i wouldn't want them to say ,   " what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage ,  dad ?  !  ?  !  " 
0	almost as tedious to watch as it was to read ,  evening is a gorgeously produced failure .  .  . until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff .  vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher .  perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying .    i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas .  it gave me a headache . 
1	this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style ,  and extremely worthy of stay alive .  for me ,  it is he best example of film noire since chinatown .   it will ,  unfortunately ,  never get the recognition it deserves .  it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals .   i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot . 
0	i don't know what the oscar voters saw in this movie ,  but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture oscar .  all i know is that fortunately there was gene kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as i believe it is .  first of all ,  i don't think leslie caron was really fit to play such a role .  she isn't that talented ,  she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all .  it's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if leslie caron hadn't been in this ,  it might have made a terrific movie .  the story was intelligent ,  the directing wasn't bad ,  and ,  as i said ,  gene kelly was pretty good .  now i'm not saying all this stuff about leslie caron just to criticize her ,  i'm just saying it because i think that's what the worse part of the movie is .  she's probably a good actress but i can't tell because i haven't seen her in anything else but i think she was pretty bad in  " an american in paris "  .  so if you want to see it ,  go ahead but i'm telling you ,  you're way better off watching  " singin' in the rain "  . 
1	the larger-than-life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson ,  and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull ,  loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with james stewart .  although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story ,  winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece ,  with the eponymous ,  one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners ,  including a wry trader  ( john mcintire ,  especially great )  and outlaw dan duryea ,  who's even more despicable than usual .  the film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann's pared-down ,  compositionally rigorous film-making .  his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun ,  but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement ,  and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick millard mitchell .  mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns .  instead of gazing at vistas from afar ,  he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect ,  complicate ,  or evoke the human characters' goals .  just as mountains ,  caves ,  and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur ,  here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain ,  a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters .   ( i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h .  daniels's contribution ,  particularly his superlative day-for-night ,  open-range photography .  )  not merely an adept outdoorsman ,  mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp-patrolled dodge city ,  primarily through scaled ,  multiple-plane staging .  the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot .  nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue ,  relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes .  one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude :  mitchell's telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters ,  which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all .  light without feeling insubstantial ,  intense without being overbearing ,  winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold . 
1	playwright sidney bruhl  ( michael caine )  has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit .  he receives a play written by a student of his ,  clifford anderson  ( christopher reeve )  which is fantastic .  it's so good sidney says he would kill for it .  will he ?   a thinking man's thriller .  it was originally a play .  .  . and it shows .  it's mostly on one set and all talk but i was never bored .  it's very well-written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force .  caine is just great as bruhl--another one of his great performances .  reeve is ,  surprisingly ,  very good .  i never thought much of him as an actor ,  but he's really good in this role .  dyan cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as bruhls' wife .  irene worth is also good  ( and quite funny )  as helga ten drop ,  a psychic .  however ,  her accent did get on my nerves .  director sidney lumet does very well with his one set .  the camera is always moving and keeps your attention going .   extreme spoiler dead ahead !  !  !  !  !  my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses i've ever seen--but these are mild complaints .   a very good thriller .  critics hate this movie  ( for some reason )  and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982 .  that's too bad--it deserves better . 
0	the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base  .  this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script  ,  it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is  .  however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that i`ve seen
1	this is a film that has it all ,  the dashing hero ,  the beautiful damsel in distress ,  the noble figure with the tragic flaw ,  and a truly wonderful robot .  forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings  ( although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score )  .   movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams ,  although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role .  the distinguished and noble-looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret  ( id )  .  other supporting cast deserve a nod ,  especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful  " doc "  ,  and of course the charms of miss francis ,  as noted above .   this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music ,  in the 1950s ,  no less .  the credits call them  " tonalities "  ,  but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the  " theremin "  device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track .  still ,  it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell .   the special effects are also quite arresting .  i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible  " id "  monster ,  and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe .  the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways ,  guided by the enigmatic dr .  morbius .   i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr .  morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot .  the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters .  viewers of follow-on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes ,  although i recall he never had the  " personality "  of the original robby .   i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves ,  through force of will ,  to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes .  although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed ,  it remains unknown  ( or perhaps deliberately overlooked )  by dr .  morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking commander adams ,  who forces dr .  morbius to confront the evil within himself .  it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr .  morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect ,  which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine :   " here .  here is where your mind was artificially enlarged .  consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine .  but your subconscious had been made strong enough .  "  zowee !   forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever ,  and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen . 
1	this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation .  i quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style ,  it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles .   this film is certainly more about style than story .  while i found the story interesting  ( a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films )  ,  it was a bit hard to follow at times ,  and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have .  it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together .  whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer .  visually this film is a treat for the eyes ,  and in that sense a work of art .   if you like adult animation ,  or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment .  i would recommend it .  all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better
0	ironically ,  although he can do the  " splits "  ,  thomas is a complete stiff as an actor .    this film is seared into my memory as one of the most side-splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen .  as such ,  i'm actually rather fond of it .    still , the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape ,  and it's fun to see his tiny ,  muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the east european country side  ( including the infamous  " pommel horse "  shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers )  .  but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote ,  and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits .    thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor .  everyone else in the film - actors ,  director ,  editor ,  camera guys ,  etc .  is at least as bad ,  or even worse ,  and most of them are professionals .  so kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think .    i hope poor kurt took the money and ran .  if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again ,  i'll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face . 
1	henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like .  it is a fooler .  through fonda's performance we are led to believe  ( on the surface )  that abraham lincoln was a country bumpkin .  but ,  through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings ,  you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him .    in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor .  it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years .  when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect .  there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard .  he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940 .   the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war .  he goes forward into history .  the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous .  definitely worth seeing again . 
1	this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year .  the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted .  it is a beautiful thing .  there were a lot of quality one-liners .  this movie blew uncle sam out of the water  ( it was made by tha same people ,  i think ) 
0	it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film .  an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in  " rabbit test .  "  so ,  as a small contribution to this future effort ,  i'd like to suggest this word :     " hubiriffic "   ( adj .  )  a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific' ;  used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film  " rabbit test .  "   joan rivers and  " hollywood squares "  producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness .  trying to put together an airplane !  style comedy with a moldy collection of gags ,   ( note to joan :  german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville )  disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that's is bad enough .  but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style ,  which can best be described as 'ugly' ,  and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags .   adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel .  watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield ;  eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face .   i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test .  cabbages ,  mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates .  but for self-aware ,  thinking humans - i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend  " rabbit test .  " 
0	the good :   effective color scheme .  good costumes .  top notch set production .  well detailed cgi buildings and vehicles .   the bad :   horrible mixture of actors with all cgi actors mixes fifth element with final fantasy .  the cgi actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago .  flawed logic .  a giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it ,  no one really even questions it ?  and there is no explanation as to why the god horus was even cast out ,  nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate jill ?   the ugly :   awful script .  so many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized .  the dialog was almost laughable at some points .  random characters and events that are not needed .  dull characters .  jill is supposed to be this mystery ,  but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer .  there is nothing to her .  she is uninteresting and boring to watch .  she has no substance ,  no texture .  her character has no redeeming qualities .  in fact ,  there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose ,  any goals  ( besides the obvious one of horus )  ,  any motivation .  they are weak and ill-conceived .  there are no stakes - the key to screen writing .  horus will not become immortal ,  but ,  big deal ,  he is a bad guy .  one cannot even decipher whether horus or jill is the main character .  that is the problem :  devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character ,  never brings one to fruition .  they are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces .  first time director pacing .  slow ,  slow ,  slow .  i am still watching the movie as i write this .  i cannot pay attention because it is boring .  everything is flat .  even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary .   overall :   not worth a watch .  threadbare story ,  sub-par character development ,  corny cgi does not save the nice set production . 
0	i had to stop watching this film  ( a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers )  twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns ,  not to mention that i was soon near tears over the $3 . 99 i had wasted at blockbuster .  joanna pacula's acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth .  i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many .  both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents .  while we're on the topic of talent ,  breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe .  she clearly has not learned her craft .  in fact ,  she's really quite awful .  all the public scenes looked staged ,  with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best .  turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on .  don't rent this terrible movie .  you will be sorry you spent your money . 
1	faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer  ( or something )  ,  relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that .  downbeat  ( in a petit-bourgeois sort of way )  ,  philosophical and blackly humorous ,  the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski  ( no disrespect to cb intended )  .  mordantly funny ,  but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations ,  the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask :  why aren't other films like this ?  one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film . 
1	it was only on my second viewing ,  years later ,  that i realized two things about this movie :  1 )  i enjoyed it immensely ,  and 2 )  that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants .  i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests--valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness  ( even *good*-natured airheadedness )  just aren't inherently funny ,  especially when drawn out to feature length .  but though the movie's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end ,  reeves and winter and sadler  ( and hal landon jr .  in an unforgettable scene )  display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily-scripted jokes  ( e . g .  ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell )  work as effortlessly as the witter ones  ( e . g .  the challenge )  .  and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted  ( who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie ,  disaster if they're not well-matched )  appears utterly unstrained .    ( side note :  i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining--sightly different comic sensibilities there ,  it seems .  )   i give it a 7 . 75 .  surprisingly good fun . 
1	there is some spectacular ,  heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals ,  from arctic to tropical and everything in between .  the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work .  editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too ,  with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world .  where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns ,  climate change ,  individual animal stories and hunter/ hunted interactions across multiple environments .  eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed .  overall ,  well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect oscar material . 
1	 " a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read .  a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read .  "  -mark twain  'classic' seems to be the word used to describe  " scarface "  ,  brian depalma's 1983 film about opulence ,  self surrender ,  greed ,  and danger among florida's drug ring .  people and critics  ( and rappers for that matter )  deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films . ' when it is anything but .  it is praised for all the wrong reasons .  scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over ,  but not all the praise it gets from audiences today ,  and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public .   first off ,  the film is about a cuban refugee ,  with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness .  simple ?  yes .  but the layers of de palma's directing genius ,  and the great story written by oliver stone  ( yes i know ,  he actually wrote a real good one here )  play into all of it .  the characters are all looking for an escape ,  as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all .  each character has something to offer ,  that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film .  they are entwined in a world of mystique and money ,  but all that has a price ,  as they all learn .  each character thinks they are getting better chances in life ,  when in true dramatic irony ,  they are actually getting worse .  'tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie .  all those who praise the film for it's drug usage ,  it's violence ,  it's dialog ,  totally missed the point .  there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves .  and that is why the film works so well .  the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film ,  not to look cool or attract viewers .  brian de palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters ,  or brainless action fans .   next on ,  the film is an adult drama .  it is not a 'gangster film' .  it has it's share of action ,  but the action is plotted very carefully ,  so it has a point .  it's not like  " aliens " - an example of a big dumb action film ,  and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people .  ridiculous .  hogwash .  if this film is about that ,  then it is about how bad it is .  not a promotion of it .    this being said ,  the film is indeed a great film .  it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story .  it has a very dramatic score  ( in true giorgio moroder style )  ,  which simply could give you chills ,  or bring you to tears .  the film is rather lengthy ,  but it is a story ,  and each moment counts .  the acting is terrific .  al pacino - enough said .  he can do any role that he puts his mind to ,  and this was no exception .  pretty boy steven bauer ,  as manny .  i didn't think much of him in other films he did ,  but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palma's direction .  michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira .  popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in  " grease 2 "  she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye .  but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony's sister gina ,  who when she smiles ,  or cries ,  we see her soul and her fresh way of living ,  and watch it deteriorate ;  paul shenar as alejandro sosa ,  a drug lord ,  who runs deeper than a river ,  and shenar portrays him as so ;  and miriam colom as tony and gina's torn mother .  these three dig the film as deep as it can go .    this reviewer learned one main thing when watching  " scarface "  for the first time .  always go into a film unsuspecting .  all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see .  only knowing de palma  ( like i do )  can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds .  so ignore the rap crap ,  ignore the mindless violence supporters ,  and fix yourself a glass of bailey's on the rocks ,  and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film ,  the real  " scarface .  " 
1	in today's world of digital fabrication ,  there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer .  alas ,  this type of  " character driven "  film is far too rare these days .  duvall's performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations .  i wonder if this movie was made for tv ?  it has a  " close-up "  personal quality to the narrative .  it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding .  the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer ,  but pretty pictures are not everything .  how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing ? 
0	before i begin ,  you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba's films .  his biographical series of the life of his master ,  mas oyama ,  were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made ,  as were most of his street fighter films .  the action was practically non-stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee  ( depending on who you ask )  ,  he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s .  because they are so good ,  i've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more  ( which i am in the process of watching )  .   unfortunately ,  despite my love of these films ,  i am not a mind-numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 .  there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being chiba's best work .  a score of 10 isn't a real rating--it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba ,  not this film !  as i said ,  technically this film is awful .  some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version ,  with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing .  but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print .  the camera-work is simply atrocious--like it was done by chimps  ( smart chimps ,  but still chimps nonetheless )  .  often ,  much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production .  and ,  again and again ,  the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched--with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly .   i don't know whether the musical score is original or not--but it was also very ,  very bad .  sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone's  " spaghetti western "  music--it was annoying ,  distracting and just plain silly .   as for the martial arts action ,  i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit .  instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a chiba film ,  the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera !  !  so what you are left with is the story .  .  . and this might just be the worst part of the film !  it's supposed to be an anti-drug film starring sonny chiba as .  .  .  . sonny chiba !  and when the film begins ,  he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan .  but ,  the mafia  ( complete with not a single member who looks italian ,  but who are all japanese )  vows to stop chiba .  and ,  when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade ,  he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions--even though she's never forthright about telling him what she knows !  in fact ,  later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine--and he continues trying to protect her !  !  this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script--such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk .   so if it was that bad ,  why still does it merit a 3 ?  well ,  first ,  there are many more horrid marital arts films  ( such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s ) --including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting  ( now that's bad )  .  second ,  while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films ,  compared to its contemporaries ,  it's not that bad .  still ,  you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film .   by the way ,  if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film ,  it certainly is not !  in one of his first films ,  invasion of the neptune men ,  chiba plays a leotard-wearing super-hero who battles pointy-headed invaders from the planet neptune .  it's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler's brain for awfulness .   a final note to parents--like most of sonny chiba's films ,  this one is very violent and has its share of boobies .  don't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg !  make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated-r martial arts films ! 
1	the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first .  the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off .  however ,  i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem .  i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy -- sarah's character is a true sociopath ,  very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank .   the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast .  her sister's character is good ;  funny at times ,  but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show .  however ,  the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison .   i'm glad ,  though ,  that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor . 
1	i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film .  if you sit close to the screen ,  you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures .  the detail ,  colors ,  and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story .  how they were able to pull off the shading ,  i will never know .  i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished .  based on this film ,  i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film . 
0	and i thought the beach was bad ,  with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time ,  nicolas cage .  don't blame him for the awful script ,  if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie ,  give your self a pat on the back .  its a cross between the village and a crappier script .  its starts off kinda catching your eye ,  and then as it goes further into the plot ,  it just makes no sense ,  and don't get me started about the ending !  !  !  !  what was that ?  the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor ,  and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations .  if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch ,  save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why ,  just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind ,  and there you go ! 
1	this is absolutely the best none-animated family film i've seen in quite a while ,  back to the first homeward bound .  paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's pov .  it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films ,  up to disney status ,  imho . 
0	i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good-looking horror movie to watch over the new year's weekend .  as i was looking through the shelves ,   " severed "  spotted my eye ,  and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b-grade horror movie .  the cover looked fairly good .  the plot sounded semi-interesting .  so i rented it .  what a mistake .  don't be fooled by the cover ,  which actually looks decent .  i'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself .  the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo-inspired ,  ritualistic serial killer called  " the head hunter "  ,  who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city  ( probably los angeles )  ,  and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder .   story sound somewhat good ?  well ,  it is ,  and this movie could've been halfway decent .  but good god ,  it was bad !  almost everything about it was laughable .  the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge ,  outdated cell phone ,  and for whatever reason ,  she goes outside and talks to some guy .  then ,  a shadow comes up behind them ,  hacks off his head ,  and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling  ( for absolutely no reason )  while trying to dial 911 .  sound ridiculous ?  yep ,  you bet it is .  the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs-quality camera ,  and i'm assuming it was .  the acting was mostly awful ,  and the special effects were far from believable .  and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful - the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone's bathroom .  everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious ,  and it didn't hold my interest for very long ,  and i often found myself bored and tired ,  mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography .  the pacing was bad .  everything was just bad .   overall ,   " severed "  is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b-movie .  the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget ,  it could've been alright .  but this movie fell flat on it's face .  if you're expecting something semi-decent ,  you'll be sorely disappointed .  only recommended if you can tolerate d-grade horror flicks .  otherwise ,  you'll probably want to stay away from this straight-to-video garbage .  it had a little potential ,  but it was beyond a mess .  1/10 . 
0	1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray .  first they sent us to eyes wide shut .  then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year .  what is it about ?  who the heck knows .  its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting .  i always like to stay and watch the credits ,  but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough .  most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at ,  felt pretty much the same way .  dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers .  it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful . 
1	eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show . i love his impressions of mr .  t , ed norton and ralph cramden of  " the honeymooners "  , elvis presley , and michael jackson too . the ice cream man , goony goo goo , is also funny . i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984 . i laughed so hard , i almost fell off my chair . i still think this is very funny .   eddie murphy , when he was on  " saturday night live "  , made me laugh so hard , he is one of the best people to come out of " saturday night live "  .  " eddie murphy delirious " is his best stand up performance next to  " eddie murphy raw "  .   i give  " eddie murphy delirious "  2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars . 
0	today i found  " they all laughed "  on vhs on sale in a rental .  it was a really old and very used vhs ,  i had no information about this movie ,  but i liked the references listed on its cover :  the names of peter bogdanovich ,  audrey hepburn ,  john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me ,  the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it .  i searched imdb ,  and the user rating of 6 . 0 was an excellent reference .  i looked in  " mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003 "  and  wow  four stars !  so ,  i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it .  indeed ,  i have just finished watching  " they all laughed "  and i found it a very boring overrated movie .  the characters are badly developed ,  and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story .  the plot is supposed to be funny  ( private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing )  ,  but i have not laughed along the whole story .  the coincidences ,  in a huge city like new york ,  are ridiculous .  ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man ,  with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt ,  antonio banderas or george clooney ,  is quite ridiculous .  in the end ,  the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten ,  murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie ,  and whose life was showed in  " star 80 "  and  " death of a centerfold :  the dorothy stratten story "  ;  the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen ,  the future mrs .  keith richards ;  the always wonderful ,  even being fifty-two years old ,  audrey hepburn ;  and the song  " amigo "  ,  from roberto carlos .  although i do not like him ,  roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as  " the king "  .  i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions  ( manly dorothy stratten )  .  my vote is four .   title  ( brazil )  :   " muito riso e muita alegria "   (  " many laughs and lots of happiness "  ) 
1	i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed .  it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be .  the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue .   ( by the way ,  i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes )  .   the film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours - reds ,  yellows etc - which makes it look quite unique .  the cast are also quite good .  the prudish bunny packard and the devil-possessed delores salk are a stand out .   the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other 'lampoon' series . 
1	this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it .  as the credits rolled ,  the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go .  after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film .   yes it was formulaic and predictable ,  but that somehow added to it's charm .  the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions .   a real feel-good film ,  punctuated throughout with outstanding music .  when it's released ,  i'll buy it ! 
1	i must admit ,  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  " steamy romance "  i was a little bit skeptical .   " steamy "  ?  in a movie from 1968 ?  ?  i was prepared for disappointment .  and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white ,  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed .   boy ,  was i wrong !  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love ,  fear of the secret being found out ,  a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic .  you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white .  the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years .  and the performances from the two stars  ( essy persson and anna gael )  are intense and memorable .  ok ,  so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls .  it's 1968 .  do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this ?  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then .  anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much .   i think this movie was way ahead of its time .  the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure ;  yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination ,  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown .   i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here .  as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action :  although it won't be all you expect ,  i don't think you'll be too ,  too disappointed . 
0	necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic  " moby dick "  .  john barrymore is captain ahab ,  who falls in love with the pastor's daughter ,  joan bennett .  his brother derek is a rival for ms .  bennett's affections .  when mr .  barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident ,  bennett rejects him .  he must slay the whale and win bennett back .  .  .   there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences ;  particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg .  the film hasn't aged well ,  however ;  there are much better films from the time ,  both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies .  the two name attractions ,  john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best .    **** moby dick  ( 8/14/30 )  lloyd bacon ~ john barrymore ,  joan bennett ,  lloyd hughes
1	police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself . compared to other action films , police story makes schwarzenegger and stallone look like beginners . the stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb . if new line cinema has any sense , they would release this in theaters . 
1	i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film .  story lines fail ,  and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste .  but ,  then i saw zentropa  ( europa )  and my faith was renewed .  not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating .  the narrator  ( max von sydow )  takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 .  we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death .  unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing  ( for example )  a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments .  i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means .  i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email .  enjoy it ! 
1	with the advent of the imdb ,  this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience .  why ?  because users here who do a search on two-time academy award winner glenda jackson can find 'the return of the soldier' among her credits .  so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie .  fans of ann-margret can give the title a click ,  as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates .  not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay .  any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb ,  given all the cross-referencing that goes on here .  so ,  why isn't this movie out on dvd ?  don't the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film ?  and 'the return of the soldier' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered .  get with it ,  people . 
0	whattt was with the sound ?  it sounded like it was all dubbed .   otherwise ,  bad .  plot = bad .  accents = bad  ( even dougray ,  and we live in scotland )  ,  acting = bad ,  harp = bad ,  sex scenes - bad/cringeworthy .   still ,  we watched it until the end in disbelief .  how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly ?  will they ever get a decent job again ?    bad ,  bad ,  bad .  by the way ,  we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot ,  etc .   and to the older reviewer - i totally agree ,  it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s .  how did it get made in 2004 ?   ok ,  ok ,  there were some ok bits .  they had a nice house in bristol .  dougray had a nice boat .  jennifer looked nice in a little outfit .  but how come the sister got all the men ? 
1	i am not going to lie ,  this is a great movie .  i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre .  i saw it a second time ,  and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes .  sid  ( the sloth )  is not all that flattering ,  but diego  ( a mountain lion ,  i think )  is really good in the movie .  the animation is outstanding ,  and the story has a touching ending .  it is worth taking kids 10 and under to ,  but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring .  also ,  the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting .  like i said ,  it is a pretty good movie ,  but i would rate  " toy story 2 "  or  " shrek "  higher .  8/10
0	can i give this a minus rating ?  no ?  well ,  let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch .  it was painful .  boringus maximus .  the plot (  ?  )  is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity .  i rented this film with a friend and ,  after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better ,  we decided to  " fast forward "  a little to see if things would get any better .  it never gets better .  this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls ,  sounds interesting ,  but ,  in reality ,  it is just a bore .  nothing even remotely interesting ever happens .  if you ever get the chance to watch this ,  do yourself a favor ,  try  " plan nine from outer space "  instead . 
1	robot jox tries hard ,  but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot ,  man against man ,  man against woman .  the premise had potential ,  but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed .  still ,  it was fairly good ,  for a science fiction action movie .  part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman .  for those who aren't familiar with the name ,  haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel  " the forever war .  "  it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels ,  right up there with robert heinlein's  " starship troopers "  and john steakley's  " armor .  "  and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie ,  rather than giant robots .  it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's  " starship troopers ,  "  which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on .   despite some assumptions ,  this really isn't based on homer's  " iliad .  "  a couple of names are all they had in common .  achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad ,  which didn't include achilles' death .  nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior .  he was the mightiest ,  but also vengeful and petty .  even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit .  he was named hercules ,  while the greek iliad would have had herakles .   the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget .  true ,  it wasn't comparable to  " terminator 2 "  a year later ,  but that movie cost ten times as much .  the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in  " the empire strikes back "  and  " return of the jedi .  "  better ,  in fact ,  than a lot of ray harryhausen animation ,  which is highly regarded ,  but quite dated .   don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed .  it's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts . 
1	i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era .  i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program .  it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down .  i thought jerry o'connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war .  i went to school with guys who came back .  some had changed more than others and some not so much .  it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough .  live through it and then make comments .  i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job .  thank you for a trip  ( sad and good )  down memory lane . 
0	well .  .  . the movie was a fun watch .  the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by .  like vampires that walk in the sunlight .  though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies .  a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams  " ow this hurts .  .  . it's really stuck .  "  then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while .  and there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot .  come to think of it ,  nothing really made sense ,  but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect .  come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful ,  and the zombies were just fun to watch .  slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more .  but you know ,  all in all you can't expect schindlers list but its a fun watch . 
1	this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me .  the representation of the court of chancery as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent .  the acting is marvellous ,  from the sinister tulkinghorn ,  to the dedlocks ,  smallweed ,  crooke ,  miss flyte ,  and the two young lovers .  but it is the spider's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together ,  and the cinematography is superb .  what mistake did the bbc make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the uk on either video or dvd for many years ?  i tried to find out from them ,  but faced a stone wall .  in the end i got a dvd copy from canada . 
1	the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial .  karloff plays dr .  janos rukh ,  creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe .   before several guests ,  including lugosi as dr .  benet ,  an astro-chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories ,  he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element ,  here termed  " radium x "  ,  contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago .  karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories ,  but radium x is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range ,  and cures blindness at short range .  rukh is careless ,  however ,  and poisons himself ,  glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials !  dr .  benet is on hand to devise a counter-active for the radiation ,  but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid .  convinced he has been cheated ,  he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris ,  including his estranged wife ,  and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death .  .  .   along the way we get the old pseudo-scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer  ( a remarkably distinct karloff !  )  and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members .  and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris !   the invisible ray is great fun ,  aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris .  the film lacks pace ,  but is always absorbing .  karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific .  universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster ,  this time with lon chaney jr .  as the glowing menace  ( this time caused by electricity )  and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here .  the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire .  not as famous as other universal horrors ,  perhaps ,  but it works and is highly entertaining . 
1	watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance .  the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey ,  as i tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by daniel craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent .   it turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend ,  so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises .  but i'd been caught by anne reid's compelling performance and i was hooked .  the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves ,  when she exudes sadness .   the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking .  shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up ?  not here and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the mother's sexuality .  even more startling are the drawings she's made that  ( spoiler !  )  once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on here .   cathryn bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast ,  but that could be me .  with her waves of pre-raph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla ,  whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind .  bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didn't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses .   the ending is weak .  if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons .  whatever she's done ,  she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years ,  and i found the lack of sympathy jarring .  for a film so full of emotion  ( and be warned it's like opening champagne ,  you'll never get the lid back on )  the ending is a cold contradiction . 
0	cheap and manipulative .  this film has no heart .   it's also got dire dialogue ,  unconvincing characters and a preposterous ,  or rather non-existent ,  story .  it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest !   and the hedgehog !  !  !  ! how many cheap shots can a film take ?  the hedgehog ,  by the way ,  gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon .   if you have considered watching this film ,  don't .  i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie .  it scores a big ,  fat zero with me .  strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters .  yawneroony !   still ,  if you liked dancing in the dark .  .  .   
0	i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film ,  and of the few reviews that there are to be positive .  i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed .  i didn't find it very enjoyable at all .  it was slow ,  and lacks the entertainment value .  even the murder scenes are lackluster ,  with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all .  and the supposed great twist ending is really not much ,  i did see it coming ,  and then the ending just seemed cliche .  this movie may not get much mention ,  but by the little that it does get ,  it is overrated .  i would not recommend this movie . 
1	jeff wincott is not only a hunk ,  he can kick butt !  this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time .  ok ,  so maybe bridgette nielson isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician ,  she did a great job nontheless !  and let's not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert/stuntwoman karen sheperd .  so she's not cynthia rothrock ,  who cares ?  !  she's just as good ,  if not better !   ( just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie ,  one word :  ouch !  !  )  .  my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible ,  because if you haven't seen it ,  you're really missing out on some great martial arts action . 
0	what's to like about this movie ?  ?  ?   it is in colour !    it has some impressive underwater photography !    it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times !    so 3 out of 10 !    sometimes the music is speeded up !  especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in !    sometimes it is slowed !  as if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy !    as another one bites the dust !  as if in a  " spagetti western "  this has much similarity to !    it's not that the italians can't produce quality productions !  there was a series of tv movies with a heading like  " octopus "  numbered about 1 to 7 ,  screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts !  and they were excellent !  but alas ,  you won't find it here !  !  !   i assumed it was made about 1960s !  sadly it was 20 years out of date ,  as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end !    then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters !    amidst it all ,  either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark ,  the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern ,  as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development !    at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly ,  for his ex-wife !    but of course ,  even if the music fails to awaken our realisation ,  we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices ,  as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge !    and near the end ,  someone thought of a twist !  just when we thought it was all totally predictable !  but stay tuned ,  folks ,  for you may find another twist !  if you are watching closely !  to ,  more or less ,  warm your heart !    follow the advice of the hero ,  and have a few beers along the way !  it'll make your viewing of  " night of the sharks "  more enjoyable !    then you'll be ready for something like a  " 007 "  movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over !  !  ! 
1	i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago ,  and i was very happy with the movie when i left it .  it's very intense ,  and the closest i've come to crying in a movie in quite some time .  that is a credit to adam sandler ,  who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels ,  and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it ,  were it not coming out so early in the year .  don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam's disturbed .   there is some humor ,  but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments ,  as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him .  adam plays two levels very well .  .  .  when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable ,  but when he is ,  well ,  less stable he's powerful and dark .   i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss . 
0	is this the movie ?  ?  ?  is this what indians are trying to show ?  ?  i think this is one more effort from a sick-minded director to turn down pakistani soldiers and in fact country .  .  .  . but what we pakistani's know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our lives .  .  . not only in armed counters .   well .  .  . this is bad filmed as that of border in early 1997 .  .  . and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in kargil by pakistani armed forces ,  by creating films like these .  .   one thing is very clear .  .  . whenever there will be an encounter between pakistan and india .  .  .  . we will win .  .  .  .  !  !  !  so mr .  dutta try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
1	the late ,  great robert bloch  ( author of psycho ,  for those of you who weren't paying attention )  scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid .   ( i had to walk miles just to see a movie ,  and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater ;  seeing a horror movie was always unnerving ,  but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one .  )  when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape  ( which should always be a last resort )  ,  i was surprised at how well it held up .  take the terror test :  watch it at night ,  alone ,  and then tell me it's not scary .  .  . 
1	the question is ,  can a movie this entertaining really be considered a  " bad "  movie ?  my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words  " vestron pictures "  on it  ( vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films  " suburbia "  and  " class of 1984 "  )  .  we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was .  your basic plot as is follows :  grange ,  this goombaesque thug from planet earth ,  robs  " the bank of the moon "  and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet  ( i don't even remember the planet's name )  to mine for bauxite and other minerals .  the  " governor "  of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor .  walker ,  a bounty hunter  ( apparently one of only three on the whole planet )  reminds the prisoners that there is no escape ,  because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with .  then there's the nameless  " colonel "  ,  a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare .  much of the movie centers around  " futuristic "  car chases  ( dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides )  with explosions galore .  the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ,  ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts .  but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid-80s .  i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl ,  but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack .  i can't even remember the names of the bands  ( they're listed in the credits )  other than exploding white mice ,  because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie ,  but i'm definitely looking into them .   basically ,  the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends . 
0	i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria .  so didn't have an idea what i am going to see .  the story is very normal .  the movie is very long  ,  i believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story .  its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more  !  ashton kutcher was very good  .  kevin costner is ok .  the movie is speaking about the us coast guards ,  how they are trained  ,  their life style and the problems they face .  as there aren't much effects in the movie .  so if you want to watch it  ,  then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema .  would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds . 
1	this is a great film .  if this is any indication ,  than hong sang-soo really is  " asian cinema's best kept secret "  .  it's very similar in style to tsai ming-liang and hou hsiao-hsien ,  and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically ,  but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films .  the overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work ,  although it still completely fits that style  ( the camera never moves even once )  ,  and somehow i found the film less self-consciously  " slow "  than tsai ming-liang or hou hsiao-hsien ,  which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more .  plus ,  it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as hou does .  i felt like the film was also somehow more  " complete "  and less open-ended  ( just barely )  than some of their work ,  although that's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward-moving plot .  i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasn't directly influenced by this film for  " lost in translation "   ( scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself ,  and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can't help but seem familiar )  . 
0	this film is terrible .  i was really looking forward to it ,  as i thought  " lantana "  was great .   the following review may contain *spoilers*  *****  first ,  the good things :  it looks great ,  some of the performances are ok .  the bad things are everything else about it .    the story ,  as you possibly know ,  is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body ,  with the twist that they find it on friday but continue fishing and finally report it on sunday when they get back into mobile  ( cell phone )  range .  however the film takes it's time  ( boy does it take its time )  getting to this central event .   of the ensemble of characters  ( about a dozen )  ,  not one seems to like another one  ( which is ,  i suppose ,  consistent ,  because they are all unlikable )  .  i was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related ,  and it was not until near the end of the movie that i could vaguely construct the family tree .    it's hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim ,  which is a failure in the structure of the story ,  as the character's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after .  once you've set the bar so high ,  it's hard to up-it short of everyone committing suicide .   there are silly lapses in logic .  the killer dumps the body in the lake ,  and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains .  the fishermen walk out sunday morning ,  but for some reason byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed .  then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station .  um ,  they haven't heard of the telephone ?  down at the station ,  the media know the whole story ,  less than 24 hours after they reported the body ?   totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body .  this is a mystery - everyone asks them  " how could you do that ?  "  and the audience is asking the same question .   ( the debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in  " deliverance "  )  .  i know exactly what i'd do in their situation .  someone needs to walk out to the car ,  drive to mobile range ,  call the cops ,  wait ,  and them guide them back to the location .  if the others wait at camp and fish ,  who cares ?   a lot of all this just seems false .  the only thing that rung true was that ,  as the girl was black ,  the local aboriginals seized on the fishermen's actions as racist -  " wouldn't have done it if it was a white girl .  "    throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl  ( i think the subject is mentioned once )  ,  and there is no mystery ,  as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene .   so i'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused ,  when there's a twist - not in the plot ,  but the theme .  suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about black-white reconciliation .  huh ?   this is australian film  " at its finest "  ,  according to the age . 
0	 " masters of horror "  has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes , ' and while a definite case can be made for joe dante's 'screwfly solution'  ( one of the best episodes of the series ,  period )  ,  most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive  ( nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox )  .  and 'pro-life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence ;  young angelique  ( caitlin wachs )  ,  seen running through the woods ,  is nearly hit by 2 doctors  ( mark feuerstein and emmanuelle vaugier )  who just happen to be driving in to work at the local  ( and isolated )  abortion clinic .  angelique's father ,  dwayne  ( ron perlman )  ,  is a stone-cold ,  far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion .  if for nothing else ,  'pro-life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue ,  but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself  ( which is admittedly poor )  ;  the slow pacing builds no tension ,  and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl .  even when dwayne and his sons storm the clinic ,  guns blazing ,  it is a stunning non-event ;  later ,  when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion , ' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film .  the poor performances  ( perlman is sadly wasted here )  become an outgrowth of the script ,  and carpenter's direction feels exhausted ,  as if 'pro-life' is the source of his next hot meal .  by the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways ,  you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking .  .  . 
1	a common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind ,  and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature .  in power of kangwon province ,  we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that ,  trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of kangwon province .  however ,  rather than epiphanal moments ,  we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape .   the pace of this movie is slow ,  contemplative .  we learn in the end what really brought each to kangwon province and we learn how they're connected .  for those who want hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer ,  this movie will not satisfy .  but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking ,  wondering ,  affecting them years after ,  this movie will more than satiate that longing . 
0	writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa .  he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks .  the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time ,  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film .   unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his  " backstage "  footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast  ( also on that reel )  that was seen by millions ,  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies .  and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage ,  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera ,  not faking footage .   finally ,  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked-up version of it .   ( he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his  " smoking gun "  .  )  sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it .  what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use ,  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth ,  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth .   as with most films of this type ,  sibrel relies on innuendo ,  inexpert assumption ,  misleading commentary ,  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence . 
0	this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest ,  in my opinion .  a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her .  and at this point ,  i will say that these films are not real !  they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible .   the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases .  for example ,  when they kick the girl in the floor ,  we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl !  and how stupid this looks !  the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense .  other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl ,  the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours ,  the ripping off of fingernails ,  worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body ,  the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that .  very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant .  this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig ,  although it is not as bloody as the next part ,  flowers of flesh and blood ,  which tries to be as shocking as possible .   guinea pig :  devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is .  this is still  ( of course )  faked s ( n/t ) uff ,  the only difference to genuine  " snuff film "  is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film .  i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive .  they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it .  i watched this as a curiosity  ( as the other parts in the series )  and now i know how insignificant trash these are .  they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement .  devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole  ( guinea pig 4 )  is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen .  so these are pretty extreme in my book ,  but that's all they are . 
0	this movie is not just bad ,  not just corny ,  it is repulsive .  something about daphne ,  about the creepy call-girl ,  about the whole damn  ( and i use the word literally )  film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress .  this film makes my skin crawl ,  makes me regret having reproductive organs ,  and makes me feel unclean .   one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept .  a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results ,  rather than the cliché worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish ,  is a truly fascinating film idea .   thought :  the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights .  during the day ,  bright lights don't show up well ,  so they could go anywhere .   count the hobgoblins :  four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio ,  and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie .   discussion question :  if you had a frigid ,  demanding ,  unappreciative girlfriend ,  would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead ?  explain . 
0	i am currently sitting here ,  forcing myself to finish this .  i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs ,  might as well suffer for it .  i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for  " war of the worlds "  cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time ,  and i missed the old tv series from the early 90's .  the website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book .  it was going to be a  " perfect translation "  .  perfect crap is more in tune with this film .   first off ,  the video on this movie was glitched !  it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid-90's pc or playstation cd-rom video game .  sadly enough ,  the color quality was similar .  the acting made shatners classic  " dramatic pause "  look damn near shakespearean in quality .  the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous ,  and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes .   secondly ,  it is slow and terribly drawn out .  i sat thru 45 minutes of the video  ( no promo's at the beginning )  before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien .  after that ,  the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid .  i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk  ( crappy down even )  attached to a mechanical arm .  the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's .  the last thing on that ,  for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900's no one is concerned for their life .  it's like they have no concept .  even though media was slow ,  word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known .  the  " illusion "  of day and night was shoddy at best .  simply changing the color around the people to purple ,  blue or green does not signify night time .  perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion .  there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the  " hero "  gallop around or walk down silly roads .  get on with the film .  i know how people get around ,  you do not need to be so in-depth .   now ,  finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines .  mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects .  even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student .  the animations do not match up to the scenery at all .   in closing folks ,  if you want  " the war of the worlds "  ,  do one of four things .  1 )  watch the 1953 original ,  2 )  watch the early 90's tv series ,  3 )  wait for spielberg's rendition to be released shortly ,  or 4 )  read the frikkin book  ( something we all probably did in elementary english class )  .  avoid this movie .  it is a waste of your money . 
0	i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view ,  nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception ,  it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie .   beginning on halloween night 1968 ,  6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister .  michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again .   from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable .  the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael  ( the murderer )  is exactly the same throughout the movie ,  thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow .   for the horror/thriller enthusiast ,  there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age .  a happier medium could have been found .   from a half hour into the movie ,  not one scene is unexpected .  the acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast .   a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere .  a second positive would be the character of michael's doctor ,  who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead .   however ,  it is clear that the star ,  in jamie-lee curtis ,  is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim .   it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day ,  but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent ,  the 90s ,  it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film .   i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s .  cheers ! 
1	well i do disagreed with the other comment posted .  piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned .   specially about non real characters ,  i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did  ( and i'm not spanish )  ,  is a very real film with real characters ,  very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan .   about be a european film in contrast with an american film ,  well we different societies ,  personally i dislike american modern films a lot  ( i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few )  .   is a film about the continuous constitution of a person ,  liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes . 
0	i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely disapointed .   i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then .  being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself  ( ie no budget ,  shot on digi cam )  ,  i stand by my original comments .  this is a no budget student project  ( and not a particularly good one )  ,  released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film  ( if you read the cover )  .  so deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not .  i want my money back under the trades description act !  complete rubbish ! 
0	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen !  i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time .  completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever .   steer clear . 
1	i saw this in the early 70s  ( when i was 16 )  ,  and despite the long slow set-up ,  meetings ,  riots ,  etc ,  once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it .   ( still do ,  it has aged very well .  )  back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority .  all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative .  happily i'm no longer in such a minority .    it deftly shows  ( in a somewhat prophetic way )  the political splintering ,  unrest ,  confrontation ,  brutal repression ,  commercialisation and deception which lay ahead .   appreciation for this magistral film has grown ,  and i'm glad about that . 
1	what a delightful movie .  the characters were not only lively but alive ,  mirroring real every day life and strife within a family .  each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends .   the story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama ,  the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops .  the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions ,  actions and reactions of the characters to conflict ,  opinion ,  and resolve .   not an epic ,  but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones .  plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy . 
0	somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out .  whereas cube was taut ,  well-made ,  claustrophobic and mind-engaging ,  i'm afraid cypher is a bloated ,  tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don't add up to much ,  especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before .   cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending .  none of the characters spark off each other ,  and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy .  it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube .  it's not a bad movie ,  but it is most definitely not a good one .   when you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film ,  but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating . 
1	on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind ,  warm the heart and touch the very soul .   " lou "  is such a film .  i got  " lou "  from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business .  she watched it for a second time with me .  we were both enthralled .  her as if for the first time again .    " lou "  is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place .  it does this while being relentlessly entertaining .  bret carr's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen .  he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like ,  stuttering innocence ,  but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie .  when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax ,  i saw my wife in tears for the second time .   as a life coach ,  i facilitate individual growth and transformation ,  and this film is a  " must see "  for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation .  it is a brilliant ,  creative masterpiece with the power to change lives ! 
0	i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten .  before going to this movie the day after it came out ,  i came on imdb to check out the comments .  a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog .  i never go by other people's opinions ,  so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie .  it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen .   the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff .  since when do scary movies have sappy scenes ?  i swear ,  i'm amazed there weren't any group hug ^-^ moments .   i think i jumped .  once .  and that's because i zoned out ,  thinking about my research paper for english .  the clichéd ,  birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen .   and the characters were stupid .  my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said ,   " i have to get my mom's shawl !  !  !  "  you .  idiot .  screw the shawl !  safety is just a few steps away ,  but no ,  my mom's shawl  ( that didn't match the dress by the way )  is wayyyy more important than my health and safety .  and to top it all off ,  they take her back to her house ,  knowing that the killer knew where she lived .  god .   my friend and i also predicted the entire movie .  and not just the ,  i bet he's hiding under the bed ,  moments .  it was the ,   " he stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel "  and  " it's the detective coming down the hallway ,  not the killer !  "  moments .  movies should never be this predictable .  disney movies aren't even this predictable .   i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying ,  this was a terrible movie .  i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't buy it for $15 . 00 and then hate it .  it was just bad .  it would've been better if only one thing would've happened .  if ,  after being shot by the detective ,  the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in .  knife in hand ,  falling and stabbing the girl on his way down .  oh ,  how lovely that would've been .   don't waste your time or money .  go see a good movie . 
0	i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee .  but then ,  in poland in 2000 ,  i watched it in a complete form .  and so what ?  the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong ,  straight and fundamentally severe ladies .  the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive ,  constant masculine desire for sex ,  feminists who are shown like complete idiots  ( you may agree with them or not ,  but idiots certainly they are not )  ,  and so on .  the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like  " i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her !  "  .  this was intended to be a comedy ,  instead ,  it turned out to be a vapid farce ,  full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos .  do not waste your time on it - this is just bad . 
1	woah !  is one thing i can say about this movie .  personally i'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie ,  but i loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end .   i liked the movie ,  but i have to admit it was because i found brian krause who played charles brady very very irresistible ,  i guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie .   there was one thing that i was disappointed over .  i've watched charmed before and brian krause is married to holly marie combs ,  his kissing scene was o . k .  in sleepwalkers ,  but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with holly marie combs ,  i don't know if it is because krause and combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more ,  that was the only disappointment in the movie but i guess it was made up for with brian krause in those tight ass jeans he was wearing in the movie .   if you are use to seeing brian krause as holly marie combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie ,  he was nothing like angle boy .  although now that i think about it ,  it would be great to see krause's character on charmed taken over by evil making him something like his was in sleepwalkers .   i also have to say the music was great in this movie too ! 
0	this had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i'm 64 years old and a football fan .  i went expecting to see a football movie .  about 10 minutes into it ,  i began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie  ( particularly the acting )  could have gotten into a theater .  about half way through ,  i whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie .  although i was a little offended  ( and can see how some could be very offended if they were not christian )  at being preached to in a movie theater ,  it wasn't that big a deal .  it was ,  however ,  a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and ,  above all ,  the quality of the acting .  it is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater .  do i go to church ?  yes .  do i want to go to church when i attend a movie ?  no .  would i recommend this movie ?  absolutely not !  !  ! 
1	ok .  i'm biased .  i live near shrewsbury in england ,  where this wonderful movie was filmed .  it still looks the same now .  i remember them filming here quite vividly ,  and the fake snow on the streets for days on end .  often ,  when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film .   george c .  scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions .  his physical appearance isn't the typical miser .  scott's is big and imposing .  a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior .   we all know the story and the quotes .  the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language .  and i don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption .  this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully .  george c .  scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill .   i love this movie .  if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do .  it's usually available for a very small amount of money .  .  .  or are you too mean ? 
0	this movie is the worst i've seen in the last 5 years .  it is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash .  the film is rape/beating and revenge genre .  couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes .  he didn't go to their car ,  instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped . then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him .  .  .  so stupid scenario !  bellow hollywood  !  he was against that revenge but  " she is raped "   " they laugh to her "  so she must kill them all .  .  .  but once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle's top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy .  personally i think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang-rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money .  lol this movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won't see anything they are looking for .  .  .  this director should be banned .  .  . it is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by british cinematography which i personally like and that is the reason i've watched this .  don't do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film  .  .  . 
1	charleton heston wore one ,  james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth .  i hope no one casts him as tarzan .  linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way .  tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at .  even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain .  she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end .  as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints .  lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy .  this movie has three great actors tim roth ,  ms .  carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch .  superlative make up  ( a certain oscar )  costumes ,  sets ,  music make this the hit summer movie of 2001 . 
1	eddie izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius ,  and this is eddie at his very best .  his material is extremely witty and hilarious ,  and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage .  instead of insulting the audience's intelligence ,  he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences ,  hitler ,  the moon landing ,  and the british .  with so many memorable laughs ,  one can't help but repeat some of his lines .  forever more ,   " do you have a flag ?  "  should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine .  every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see  " dress to kill "  .  by far the best british standup comedian i've ever witnessed ,  eddie izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage .  however ,  his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is .   " dress to kill "  is a treasure ,  one that luckily has found its way to home video ,  and can and should be enjoyed again and again . 
1	this film has a lot of strong points .  it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle :  lionel atwill ,  fay wray ,  and dwight frye ,  plus leading man melvyn douglas .  it's got all the right ingredients :  bats ,  a castle with lots of stone staircases ,  a mad scientist ,  townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires ,  an  " igor " -type character ,  a beautiful girl ,  even a goofy-haired burgomeister .  the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative .  there's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script .   but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in  " kleinschloss "   (  " little castle "  )  .  the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist  ( nicely played by atwill )  who values his work more highly than human lives .   it's not top-tier material ,  because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye .  but it's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures . 
1	a remarkable piece of documentary ,  giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself  ( for further evidence ,  check out some of the comments on imdb .  .  .  !  )  .  compares extremely favourably with oliver stone's  " comandante "   ( which is mainly an in-depth examination of fidel castro's nostril hairs )  .  i don't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being ,  or yet another in the long line of populist latin-american  " caudillos "  .  nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans .  it's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but i've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what's at stake ,  and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup .  someone says in the film  " we're making history "  ,  and that's exactly what the film feels like it's capturing .  outstanding stuff . 
1	in new york ,  when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm matt saunders  ( luke wilson )  meets jenny johnson  ( uma thurman )  in the subway ,  he invites her to date and have dinner with him .  jenny immediately falls in love for him ,  they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him ,  telling that she is the powerful superhero g-girl .  after meeting his co-worker and friend hannah lewis  ( anna faris )  ,  the needy jenny becomes jealous ,  controlling and manipulative ,  and matt follows the advice of his best friend vaughn haige  ( rainn wilson )  and dumps her ,  breaking her heart .  jenny turns matt's life into hell ,  while he has a romance with hannah .  however ,  the archenemy of g-girl and former high school sweetheart of jenny ,  professor bedlam  ( eddie izzard )  ,  proposes matt to lure jenny to strip her superpowers .    " my super ex-girlfriend "  is delightfully silly and funny .  this romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining .  luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot ,  anna farris is extremely sexy as usual ,  and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in  " fatal attraction "  or evelyn draper in  " play misty for me "  .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " minha super ex-namorada "   (  " my super ex-girlfriend "  ) 
1	what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise ,  a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films .  so .  .  . could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated ?  ?  ?   " prison "  is the finnish director harlin's american debut ,  which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like  " die hard 2 "  ,   " cliffhanger "  and  " deep blue sea "  .  the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison ,  re-opened for the cause of over-population in other ,  more modern state penitentiaries .  inside the former execution dungeons ,  the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around .  the now promoted warden eaton sharpe  ( lane smith )  was there already 40 years ago ,  when this innocent man was put to death ,  and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial .  it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived .  viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past .    " prison "  contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain !  unlike any other horror picture from that decade ,   " prison "  features an amazing sense of realism !  by this ,  i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls ,  of course ,  and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed .  .  .  even though these are genuinely unsettling as well .  the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror .  the absolute best terror-moment  ( providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age )  focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire .  haunting !  !  the screenplay only suffers one flaw ,  but that's a common one .  .  . almost inevitable ,  i guess :  clichés !  the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding .  we've got the ugly ,  fat pervert with his 'cute' boy-toy ,  the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime  ( did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman ?  )  don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise ,  as there are so many other elements to admire .  the photography is dark and moist ,  the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class b-actors are excellent  ( the fans will recognize tom everett ,  tom 'tiny' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder )  .  forget about wes craven's god-awful attempt  " shocker "  or the downright pathetic cheese-flick  " the chair "  .  this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down !  especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays  ( i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves ,  hobbits and other fairy creatures .  .  .  )  this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd-release ! 
0	adrianne ,  should really get a life-without mr .   " brady "  .  she nauseates me ,  and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show .  it's pretty brainless show ,  and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death .  this makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage ,  and yet ,  i know these disagreements are all part of life .  i guess to some people this is entertainment .  if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash .  though i would not be terribly surprised .  can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore !  i hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week .  however ,  the  " a "  girl has one heck of great butt ! 
0	ahh ,  the dull t . v .  shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t . v .  movies !  some examples would be riding with death ( the most hysterically cheesy of the lot )  ,  stranded in space ( confusing and uninteresting )  ,  san francisco international ( horribly dull and unbelievably confusing )  ,  and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor .    shot in hawaii ( although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots )  ,  it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show .  the real problem is that you don ; 't like most of the characters ,  including the drab main character diamond head ,  who seemed half asleep for the entire movie ;  his boss 'aunt mary' ,  who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on ;  diamnd head's girlfriend/fellow agent ( hell ,  i can't even remember her name )  a skinny ,  wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting ;  and the singing sidekick zulu ( again ,  i can't remember his character's name ) who wasn't bad in small doses .  the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane ,  who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops .  alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable .  i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general .  nor do i care .  the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time ,  let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on .  just call this one - hawaii five no ! 
1	i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod .  if you don't expect anything else ,  such as clever plot twists and believable character development ,  you won't be disappointed .  consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people ,  especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy'  ( suzanna arquette ,  who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter )  .   mandy's face is a little too perfect ,  but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire ,  up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness ,  a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips ,  and splendidly configured legs ,  right down to her feet .   ( there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ;  mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio )  .   and no flat butt to boot ,  which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres' .  mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no .  2 ,  but from all i could see from her bikini shots ,  she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it .   mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl' ,  with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones .  her bisexual nature  ( allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no .  2 ,  who also happened to be her mother's lover )  added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses  ( always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason )  .   mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse .  if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress ,  i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages ,  especially italian and spanish - and maybe french ,  although i don't know if they would go for her type .  but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic ,  and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground .   vambo drule . 
1	the kids i took to this movie loved it  ( four children ,  ages 9 to 12 years ;  they would have given it 10 stars )  .  emma roberts was adorable in the title role .   ( expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future .  )  after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears ,  lindsay lohan ,  and paris hilton ,  it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she worked the streets .  also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan ,  rachel leigh cook ,  barry bostwick ,  and monica parker  ( with a cameo by bruce willis )  .  final takeaway :  cute film .    ( note :  i did not read the book series ,  so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone .  ) 
0	impressed !  this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw !  i didn't like the novel ,  but this movie made it worse !  very bad music ,  even worse actors  ( apart from srk of course ,  though even he doesn't manage to save the movie )  ,  and not much sense .  the director makes it all look very confusing ,  god knows why .  .  .  maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic ,  and yet credible .  well ,  he manages neither .   even if you've got a few hours to loose ,  don't watch this movie ,  please !   ( saying this for your own welfare !  )  keep searching ,  you will find something else to watch ! 
1	he-he-hello !  !  this is a really fun movie .  basically ,  in party girl ,  you have your fun-lovin' ,  independent ,  early 90's new yorker chick .  along with her party friends ,  she meets a mature turkish vendor .  it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do .  it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman .  hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties .   on a side note ,  parker posey makes this movie great .  i have never been a great fan of her ,  but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies .  there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character .  if you want good laughs and a fun time ,  make sure to watch this movie .  repeated viewings are a must . 
0	i saw the movie last night here at home ,  but i thought it was too long first of all .  second ,  the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before .  the things isn't funny in the movie :  fiancé hitting his girlfriend ,  beatings .  the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing !  some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here !  come on perry ,  you can do better then this ! 
1	i swear ,  that zombie was killed like twice ,  and kept coming back .  i gave this movie an 8 .  let's face it folks ,  this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying ,  i . e .  ,  a  " handy-cam "  ,  shot film .  hey ,  hey ,  hey ,  welcome to total indy film making .  the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents .  yes ,  the story has gaps ,  yes ,  we see the same zombies over and over again ,  but who really cares ?  take it for what it is ,  a fun and gory horror film ,  one to share with your buds ,  or to gross out the people you really care about lol .  mellow out people ,  i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like  " titanic "  or  " twister "  instead .  peace ,  and support independent film making !  !  ! 
0	in his brief 40 years on earth ,  author jack london managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible .  this 90-minute film ,  purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized ,  doesn't even scratch the surface ,  and remains a story very ripe for a modern-day retelling .  here ,  michael o'shea ,  in one of his first roles ,  portrays london ,  and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic .  he is not the problem here .  nor is a young and very beautiful susan hayward ,  playing his future wife ,  charmian ,  whose biography on london is the  " basis "  for this film .  london's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes ,  which the film skips lightly through .  so we have brief incidents with london as an oyster pirate ,  a sealer in the bering sea ,  a gold prospector in the yukon and a correspondent during the russo-japanese war .  .  . colorful events ,  for sure ,  but hardly given anything like in-depth treatment .  and alfred santell's direction  ( he also directed one of susan's first films ,   " our leading citizen ,  "  in 1939 )  is lackadaisical at best .  making things rougher here is a very poor-quality dvd ,  with a crummy-looking print source and hissy sound .  perhaps the best thing about this movie rental ,  for me ,  was one of the dvd's extras :  a catalog of all the alpha video films ,  featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters .  let's just hope that these films are in better shape than  " jack london "  ! 
1	claire denis's chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film .  the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon ,  giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction .  however ,  the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient .  for example ,  a central theme in the story is young france's inability to form strong relationships with others .  although this portrayal is executed flawlessly ,  notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france's return to her childhood home ,  the girl's lack of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development  ( or lack thereof )  as a protagonist .  the general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot .  the film raises a great deal of tension between characters ,  particularly between aimee and the men in her life ,  but never fully addresses this social friction ,  leaving the viewer unsatisfied .  the final few scenes are powerful but depressing .  denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint ,  but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama ,  chocolat is definitely not the best choice . 
0	*warning - no plot spoilers ahead ,  but movie spoilers nonetheless .  .  . * my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast .  wow - very ,  very wrong .  this movie is an overdone ,  overwrought ,  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot !  the copyright date on the box said 2005 ,  yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s ,  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos .  it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film !  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback ,  and therefore supposed to look old ,  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s .  .  .  then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up ,  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  ( yet it's a different ,  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks )  .  i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences ,  shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie !  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  ( and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes )  .  thus ,  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old ,  re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time .  the shell story ,  shot in 2005 ,  is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the  " fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ?  )  these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful ,  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie .  don't bother .  there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible . 
1	class reunion is a very underated comedy gem .  it's 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion ,  among them are the usual stereotypes ,  the hunk ,  babe ,  the fat guy & nerd etc ,  but the former students are in for a bumpy night ,  one of their classmates is walter baloer ,  the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home ,  walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation ,  ,  ,  ,   despite the dark premise ,  this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags & set pieces .  to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun & airplane movies you'll love this ,  & what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry ?  .  a great comedy which deserves a wider audience . 
0	the movie starts little cute .  there are a number of revolting scenes .  people in toilets .  good actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here .  this did not need to be crude .   forget it .  find the tv show .  disney at new low . 
0	quite possibly the nicest woman in show business ,  and the sexiest ,  debbie gives another fine performance here .  although her work in american nightmare was far superior ,  she is still worth watching in this film .   the cast is filled with your typical melrose place types ,  chiseled features and seductive curves ,  that i had never seen before .  other than debbie ,  laura nativo was the only actress i had seen before ,  in the similar delta delta die .   the plot centers around a group of california arrogants who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique .  they tell her that they have a murder club ,  and that she must kill someone to be accepted .  debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people ,  so she quickly kills a person ,  and now the group must decide what to do with her ,  after she fell for their joke .   violence :  $$$$$  ( plentiful !  debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face .  gore hounds will surely enjoy !  )   nudity :  $$$$$  ( plentiful as well !  debbie rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors .  the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked ;  man and woman alike .  julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes )  .   story :  $$  ( could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes .  i understand that b-rate films use nudity often ,  but this is borderline excessive )  .   acting :  $  ( the acting is sub standard to say the least .  rochon is always a treat ,  easily the best b-rate actress in the business today ,  but her character in american nightmare was superior .  danny wolske does a fine job as debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about )  . 
1	although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie ,  i am ashamed to say i rather like it .  not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham !  video ,  so it is most definitely worth a viewing  ( £0 . 79 a night in my local store !  )  .  watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume ,  the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following :  evil wizard-type bloke :   " at last we meet kor .  .  .  "  kor :   " thrilling ,  isn't it ?  "   amazing !  ! i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety  ( among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film ,  none of them actually happen .  no ,  i'm not joking .  .  . there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird ,  it's just trying to make you interested .  .  . classic in my opinion .  this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value !  ! 
0	here we go with other slasher movie ,  good looking people and acting from everyone was really good !   few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids !  20 years after they are still friends ,  they go to huge house ,  have fun ,  drugs and sex  ( no nudity )  for least half a hour of the movie !  again they start making pranks phone call all over again !  and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie ,   deaths scene really weird ,  really odd times too .   nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless  the twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4/10
1	i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film .  this book won national book council award in 1978 and is a very gripping read  ( pun not intended )  .  it's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid !  the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book .  having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie .  very few australian female writers were around the in the 70's therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class .  it's a precious piece of melbourne history .  it's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80's soft porn movie .  it's far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket ,  it does not represent what the movie is about at all .  those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed .  just remember this movie was made in 1982 ,  so don't expect the hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days .  this is what i like about it .  it's also great seeing noni hazlehurst in this role ,  she is just fantastic as nora and it's great watching her really acting ,  for if you're close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on playschool and better homes and gardens .  who knew she hid this talent ?  this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her .  a classic australian story ! 
0	fashionably fragmented ,  yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study ,  an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates :  a talented but undisciplined star basketball player ,  and a pot-smoking ,  womanizing rabble-rouser .  we never learn why these young men are friends .  they may share confusions about the world and their places in it ,  but they don't seem to have anything else in common .  making his directorial debut ,  jack nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with jeremy larner ,  based upon larner's book--doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity ,  nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen .  there are some very decent performances here  ( particularly from newcomer william tepper in the central role )  ,  but most of the picture is unformed  ( perhaps intentionally )  ,  sketchy or unsure .  bruce dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach ,  karen black is the older ,  married lady tepper is having an affair with ,  and michael margotta is tepper's wayward friend  ( in an off-putting ,  over-the-top performance )  .  nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor ,  preferring  ( i assume )  to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone ;  his script is no help either ,  and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with .  small ,  random moments do work  ( a supermarket fight between tepper and black ,  dern visiting tepper in his dorm-room ,  all of the scenes set on the court )  ,  however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess .  hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault ,  nicholson shows no style at his craft  ( nor does he earn points for chutzpah ,  as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly )  .  when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors ,  one has to question his motives in doing so .  perhaps if  " drive ,  he said "  ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain ,  audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste .  unfortunately ,  the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie .  *1/2 from ****
1	bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors .  lorne greene ,  pernell whitaker ,  michael landon ,  dan blocker ,  and even guy williams  ( as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace adam when he was leaving the series )  .  the cast had chemistry ,  and they seemed to genuinely like each other .  that made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have .  it also made many of their best stories into great western drama .   like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season ,  there are bound to be some weak ones .  however ,  most of the time each episode had an interesting story ,  some kind of conflict ,  and a resolution that usually did not include violence .  while bonanza was a western ,  the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction .  while i am a fan of the rifleman and wanted :  dead or alive ;  those shows usually ended with a gunfight .  gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict ,  and bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing .   in the early years of bonanza ,  there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights .  those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series ,  but they are pretty good in and of themselves .  in 1964 ,  when pernell whitaker wanted to leave the show ,  guy williams was brought in to replace him .  williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin .  unfortunately ,  whitaker decided to stay one more year ,  and thus williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry adam's old girlfriend .  if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza ,  one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 ,  when pernell whitaker left the show .   undoubtedly ,  once pernell whitaker left the series ,  the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks .  whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes ,  and his absence left a void in the cast .  little joe always wanted to play the nice kid ,  and hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold .  since ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family ,  that did not leave too much room for any gunfights .   at some point they hired a ranch hand called candy  ( david canary )  who became their fourth member of the cast ,  but candy was never featured in any gunfights ,  and he was hardly more than an older version of little joe .  for a year or two they also had ben take in some other lost cousin  ( jamie ,  played by the forgettable mitch vogel )  who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone .   apparently by adding the teenager ,  the studio was looking to attract younger viewers .  it also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems ,  alcohol ,  delinquency ,  etc .  those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement .  dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order tv ,  though hawaii 5-0 ,  the f . b . i .  and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing tv shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief ,  mayhem ,  and crime .   the addition of a teenager to the cast gave the cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems ,  but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general .  after dan blocker died ,  the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled .  the last season was pretty bad ,  as it featured little joe tracking down the killers of his wife ,  and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because little joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife ,  and how unfair it was that she was killed .   i don't think i have ever seen the last episode of the series ,  and i wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way .  by the last year ,  there was only ben  ( lorne greene )  actually living on the ponderosa ,  as adam had moved away  ( and never came back even once as a guest )  and hoss had died and little joe had left after his wife  ( in the series )  had been killed by drifters .   overall ,  the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series .  once adam left ,  it slowly declined .  most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too .  by 1970 ,  the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical ,  and it had lost a lot of its western flavor .  the addition of candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show ,  and the death of hoss  ( dan blocker )  was the final nail .  bonanza is probably the best western series ever made ,  and of the 465 episodes that were produced ,  at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama !  that is a pretty good record .  even the worst of bonanza is better than a lot of other tv shows . 
0	i saw this movie years ago ,  and i was impressed .  .  .  but then again i was only 12 years old .  i recently re-watched it and want that time back .  this film is pretty bad .  while i like lee majors ,  chris makepeace  ( watch my bodyguard  ( 1980 ) if you would like to see a good movie that he was in .  .  .  of meatballs  ( also starring bill murray )  for some laughs )  ,  and burgess meredith ,  this role does/did nothing for their careers .   anyway ,  lee majors character ,  franklyn hart ,  is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car  ( which he had in storage )  across the country to california .  one problem :  the government has outlawed all private transportation .  i thought the concept was ok  ( not the worse i've heard of )  ,  but the execution failed horribly . 
1	the people who are bad-mouthing this film are those who don't understand film to begin with .  these are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn't star leonardo dicaprio .  wilder napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first ,  but what it lacks in plot ,  it more than makes up for in substance .   one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it's use of music ,  which plays a large part .  those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie ,  both in vida and wilder's life ,  and in the background .  wilder's theme ,  vida's theme ,  and wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence ,  and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out .  for instance ,  in the scene where the men are singing  " duke of earl "  ,  vida is with wilder when the men sing something like  " she is my girl "  ,  and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric  " she will be my girl "  cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie ,  and while it may look like a flop on the outside ,  the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is . 
0	i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting ,  instead of watching this  " movie "   .  .  .  anything will do ,  even stare at the walls is better .   and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text ,  i tell you also is a low budget movie ,  bad acting ,  no name actors ,  a stupid mutt as the wolf ,  and so on .  .  .  also the story brings nothing new ,  the special effects are made in the 80's style .   the movie is almost as bad as the movie  " megalodon "  .   so have fun !   ;  )   ( not watching this movie ) 
1	moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan .  i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film ,  the ending wasn't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you're a fan .   i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over .  the dancing in each video is breathtaking ,  the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining .   it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos .  it also includes some live concert footage .   if you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must ,  if you're not a fan/don't like michael jackson ,  steer well clear .   9/10
1	we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies ,  and i absolutely loved this movie .  i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch .  the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone .  i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed .  this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating .  this is a movie i will show to my children .  the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women ,  but this movie was more than that .  it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite . 
1	an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's .  audiences must've been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle .  quite a contrast from his  " public enemy "  2 years earlier .  cagney does add spark & interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline & plot .  but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back .  first with the conservative  " honeymoon hotel "  number , then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  " by a waterfall "  sequence , followed by the closing  " shanghai lil "  sequence ,  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler .  the  " shanghai lil "  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic after the more exciting & incredibly mind boggling  " by a waterfall "  choreography . if i was the director i would've inserted the  " shanghai lil "  number in the middle & close with  " by a waterfall "  , which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak & in my view the best of the 3 numbers .  the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake & james cagney's performance is added decoration to the cake .  an outstanding musical achievement , a 4 star movie ,  the ultimate musical , well worth watching , you won't be disappointed !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
1	i've been watching this every night on vh1 this past week .  this is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's . woodstock , easy rider , the beatles , the death of morrison ,  hendrix ,  joplin are all here .  vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the  " drug years "  .  from the sanfrancisco bay area to studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the american culture . from marijuana to lsd to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country ,  the hippie movement ,  the conservative resistance ,  and how drugs effected the arts  ( music  ,  movies etc .  )  featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage .   drug films :  the trip easy rider up in smoke reefer madness blow boogie nights
1	i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival .  to pick up on the previous reviewer's remarks ,  the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space ,  drab architecture ,  overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe .  a bit shabby housing project style is how i'd describe it ,  and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities .  i can't say that i'm familiar with bucharest ,  romania where the action unfolded ,  but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months .    when i visited russia as a student for a semester ,  my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building ,  just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman ,  because the elevators weren't working .  but ,  i do concur with the reviewer ,  that the claustrophobia and muted colors ,  it's overdone ,  for there are ,  to be sure ,  beautiful historic buildings ,  parks ,  squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe ,  and bucharest's didn't get much of any footage in this film .  for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half-year stay there ,  feeling trapped and limited .   ( it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life ,  just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto .  )    also ,  given the climate of homophobia ,  say ,  circa ,  us in the 1980s ,  the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter ;  hence ,  the focus on their interaction in the apartment .   it's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania ,  and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing .  it's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film ,  and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources .  the actors were fairly good and believable ;  the dialog was overall well done ,  and i could identity with these women .   the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women ,  kiki ,  an energetic ,  fun-loving free spirit with a dark ,  troubling secret  ( her admiration and love for an abusive ,  incestuous brother ,  sandu )  falls in love with alexandra ,  a bright ,  bookish ,  idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies .  opposites attract ,  and their personalities seem to complement one another ,  though there is some tension between the ambitious ,  studious ,  intellectual alexandra and kiki ,  who seems to be attending college to please her parents .  keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable ,  though we don't get any sense of the tension it requires ,  nor do we ever see or meet any other students--hard to believe--and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed .  the chief threat to their love is kiki's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him .  but kiki's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond ,  or does it ?  that's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops ,  and i won't say how it concludes .   ironically ,  kiki's love  " sickness "  isn't love for another woman ,  but her illicit ,  incestuous love for her brother .  thus ,  loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling .    though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic ,  overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra ,  it was still engaging and moving to watch ,  so i'll give it a 7 . 
0	basically ,   " caprica "  is the cylon origin story .  the premise of the show is interesting .  however ,  the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling .  the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had .  in any given episode ,  little or nothing happens .   daniel graystone  ( eric stolz )  is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip .  unfortunately ,  his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe ,  who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one  ( sto )  ,  an underground monotheist extremist group .   meanwhile ,  joseph adama  ( father of  " battlestar galactica " 's commander adama )  is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter  ( who also died in the bombing )  in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica  ( which strongly resembles 1930s chicago )  .    in addition to the vapid writing ,  caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories .  we already know how it ends  ( i . e .  the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity )  . 
1	yes ,  it's over the top ,  yes it's a bit clichéd and yes ,  constance marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again !  the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show's still fun to watch .  since it's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gags .   george lopez is funny .  don't take him seriously and the show's a winner .  i'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue .  his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious .  .  .   i do have to say that the one big ,  dark ,  bitter spot is benny .  i hate the character .  .  . so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don't have to hear her .  there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes .  as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george ,  as the character ,  would stand by such a deplorable person for so long .   even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself :  seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show .  now there's a bad sitcom .  .  . 
1	in this film ,  made just as the production code was being enforced ,  jean harlow is eadie ,  and patsy kelly is the wisecracking ,  man-chasing sidekick  " kitty "  .  girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train ,  with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband ,  staying whole-some in the process .  it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins ,   ( lewis stone ,  was the kindly doctor in grand hotel ,  as well as judge hardy in the  " andy hardy "  films .  )  ,  but all is not as it seems .  .  . the censors must have loved harlow's line  " a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged .

0	this is a re-imagining of tarzan in the era of the soloflex and apocalypse now .  there's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend .  there's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that tarzan doesn't speak .  there's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in 1910 ,  could be this offensively stupid and plastic .  bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold ,  as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project .  if it succeeds anywhere it's in the implication that national geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed .   it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual tease as one of many tools to draw in viewers .  some really great film moments incorporate it .  but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here ;  at the time of its release and now .  you sit through awful ,  dumb scenes that offer no interest ,  and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies .  yes .  .  .  bo derek and miles o'keeffe are beautiful  ( um ,  congratulations on having a working libido .  )  but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up .  there's only a hairs-breadth difference between the two formats and  ( i'm just guessing here )  a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter .  the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone .   as a showman ,  john derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife bo in the movie  " 10 "  ;  and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads .  the movie itself was beside the point .  he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid ,  shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality .   as a director ,  john derek appears to require only that mrs .  derek look pleasant ,  empty and hump-able in every scene .  it's hideously shot .  the camera placement is annoying .  in terms of editing ,  the entire 'wipe' catalog is exhausted .  the credit sequence is garish .  and it's a toss-up as to who commits the worse screen offense ;  bo derek who's such a bimbo that she can't even figure out how to play a bimbo ,  or richard harris who shouts every line  ( as he likes to do )  until you want to shoot him .  at least with bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her . 
0	i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama  ( in the same vein as remember the titans )  ;  however ,  i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture .  the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie .  actually ,  one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment .  at least with the televangelist sermon ,  there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self-help pulp .  the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long-enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie . 
1	i think this film has much to recommend it ,  particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr .  foxx .  although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very ,  very hard to follow in some cases ,  all in all ,  it makes for a nice time in front of the tube . 
0	black and white film .  good photography .  believable characters .    just awful .   i have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as  " worthy "  and  " very good .  "  there is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good  ( more should have been done with this )  but it is very slow to grow and never develops .  it is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity .  more could have been done with the main characters .  if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it .  though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep ! 
0	the movie was disappointing .  the book was powerful .  the views and the learning of little tree were powerfully portrayed in the book .  the movie just coasted along and finally dribbled away .  still a nice tale for kids . 
1	i have a feeling that the warners bros depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years .  yes ,  we are in the economic doldrums  ( or have you been living under a rock )  and times look bleak .  but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles .  in the 30's ,  film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .   " footlight parade  ( 1933 )  "  was one such film that audiences flocked to .  while this lloyd bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as  " gold diggers of 1933  ( 1933 )  "  does ,  it's still a wonderful showcase of talent .  we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers ,  but boy ,  are they worth waiting for me .  yes ,  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress ,  and her tapping is so-so ,  but busby's magical  " by a waterfall "  whisks her ,  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls ,  into a dizzying water wonderland .  of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage  ( they defy limits of gravity ,  for one thing )  ,  and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough ,  wisecracking non-musical scenes .  and  " footlight "  also has james cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals  ( really ,  what couldn't this man do ?  )  .  he even gets to take over from the leading man ,  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  ( who is really little ruby in china-girl wig !  )  . he co-stars with joan blondell ,  his adorable ,  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  ( until the final reel ,  that is )  .  apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife .  and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene . 
0	one of the five worst movies i have ever watched .  and i'm not exaggerating .  in fact ,  i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching showgirls .   out of 400 votes ,  the movie gets a user rating of 5 . 3/10 .  but there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10 ,  probably due to the message of the movie - nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind .  chuck murdock is an all-star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons .  soon  " amazing grace "  smith is an all-star boston celtic who is inspired by chuck's story and gives up basketball .  soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world-wide protest .  later all the children of the world go on a silence strike .  this inspires the president of the united states to meet with the soviet premier ,  who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season .  the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch ,  with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every batter ,  as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year .   somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills amazing grace .  when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it .  so the president calls the underworld boss  (  " but it's one a . m .  "   " i don't care ,  get him on the line "  )  and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has .  and to not get out of line again .   honestly ,  this movie was so crappy that i couldn't turn it off .  it was on television from 2 : 30 am to 4 : 00 am ,  and i watched it all .  i wasn't turned off by the anti-nuclear weapons propaganda .  i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports .  i don't even understand why  " amazing grace "  smith was killed .  and with all these famous athletes becoming chuck's friends ,  why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand .  and there was the cliché moment near the end when dad tells chuck ,   " i never told you this ,  but i'm proud of you .  "  cue hug . 
1	i have to agree with most of the other posts .  was it a comedy ?  a drama ?  to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side .  i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived .  jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name .  in new york ,  how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland . and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold .  again ,  a comedy or drama ?  but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning .  i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance ,  she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously .  she is a younger actress that is going to be viable . 
1	the matador is hit-man movie lite .  .  .  . if you can say that about a hit-man movie .  the violence is never really shown but often introduced .  at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship .  nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning .  the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together .  the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes .  this is a good film that i probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy .  good film . 
0	creepy & lascivious wolf .  the young  " red "  is wearing full make-up ,  and extremely short shorts & robe .  got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile's dream come true .  the  " up-beat "  music sounds a lot like something i'd hear at a strip club .  i actually think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie .  gross ,  glad i was watching this with my daughter ,  i don't want her to think it's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together .  very bad ,  very sad it's sold as a family film ,  joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it .  and what's with advertising it as a  " special effects spectacular "  ?  ?  ?  the effects do look low budget ,  gawd awful . 
1	i love and admire the farrelly brothers !  how come i only got to see this great movie 3 years after it's release ?  it made me laugh ,  it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart .  big time .  it's hard to describe in my rotten english - but i have to try anyway :   the cast is excellent throughout - from the lead- to the supporting roles ,  the acting is great ,  the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited .   i think that the farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they're deeeeeep !  they talk about what life is all about  ( i won't tell you !  )  .   in my case ,  this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about :   if you love somebody :  set them free ,  let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other .   i'm not a sports-hater ,  but definitely a sports ignorant .  but in this movie - the vibes get you .  i could smell the atmosphere of baseball .  finally ,  this movie explained to me what being a sports-fan can mean to you and what cool fan-families there must be out there .   thanks so much ,  pete & bob !   p . s .  :  if you haven't seen it - please check out kingpin ! 
1	i borrowed  ( slightly modified )  title from some other comment .  i have to say ,  that as i usually don't like relationship series ,  i really did liked this one .  great characters ,  interesting and not cliché story ,  good acting ,  good and again not cliché  ( which in case of dialogs is rather rare )  dialogs  .  .  .  it is really interesting ,  how the characters cross paths with each other ,  and sometimes knowingly ,  sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives .  but unfortunately ,  as we say in our country - do you know how do you recognize a good us series ?  it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season .  sure ,  it isn't always true ,  but  .  .  . 
0	this film deserves another bad review .  consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex ,  violence or gore . ' uh ,  excuse me .  the very set-up of the film has us watching as cody's young comrade ,  with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless ,  bloody body .  and ,  given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis .  so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines cody's persona is erased from viewer memory .   sans any family of his own cody ,  like john rambo ,  roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city .  no mention ,  no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods .  we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war .  this explains ,  as none seem to notice or care ,  cody's obvious 'flat' effect .  it is not bad acting .  it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder .  not guessing here ,  remember his co ordered him off the battle field .   how about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review .  the fall was an accident ,  the kiss was not .  how exactly was cody 'respecting' faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for ?  now that was a non-family value moment .  a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube .  of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season ,  all cheering their cheaten' hearts and lips .   we know little about faith's fiancé except that she professes her love for him ,  she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal  ( could have waited if any second thoughts )  ,  he is generous ,  he loves her to death ,  the family has nothing really against him ,  he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans .  no evil doers here .   asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son .  .  .  . ' 'you are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named cody .  and the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field .   bottom line :  this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways .  most grossly when it applauds cody's disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for .  by re-defining family as we know it to wit :  accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you . ' how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that .  not . 
0	i admired rob marshall for chicago ,  but memoirs of geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and asian arts .  overall ,  the scene is beautiful ,  but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them .  the excessive cherry blossom was ,  frankly ,  overdone .  it's probably the cultural difference of perception here :  the ultimate beauty is not the showy type ,  as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie .    some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws .  as a taiwanese ,  i have no doubt the actress are great .  an actor/actress can play any kind of role when he/she can look like it .  gong li is great ,  but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into japanese style .  all i saw was a bittersweet and jealous chinese woman .  michlle yeoh ,  one of my favourtie actress ,  did not even look like a japanese .  some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate ,  feminine characteristics of japanese women ,  with which i can't agree more .  these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha ,  let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much .   geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of american audiences .  but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume ,  best director or best picture . 
1	the good thing about this movie :  the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes .  it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing .  its a small world and this little movie shows us .   the bad thing : there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie .   its a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven't seen .   8/10  not rated---i would rate it pg-13 for brief violence , some language and sexual situations . 
1	if your idea of a thriller is car chases ,  explosions ,  and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire ,  then  " house of games "  is definitely not the movie for you .  if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense ,  then ,  by all means ,  see it .    " house of games "  tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer ,  dr .  margaret ford  ( lindsay crouse )  ,  who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike  ( joe mantegna )  .  to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense .  frankly ,  i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming .  just like a clever con artist ,  this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance .   the story is taut and well-crafted ,  the dialogue smart and laconic ,  the acting uniformly good  ( mantegna is superbly charismatic )  .  some have complained that dr .  ford is not a very sympathetic character ,  and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive .  but dr .  ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ;  moreover ,  her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot  ( at one point ,  i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation  .  .  .  i'll say no more )  .    " house of games "  is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity .  it will hold your attention every second while you are watching ,  and stay with you for a long time afterwards . 
0	every generation fully believes it is living in the end times .  this has been true for thousands of years now .  and movies like this feed on this .  how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck ?  this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon .  it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made ,  making it obviously dated and kind of silly .   the reenactments look like they are out of  " unsolved mysteries "  but without the high production values .  people should have been embarrassed to take part in this .   in short ,  the movie is dated ,  silly ,  reactionary ,  and useless .  good if you want a good laugh ,  but not good enough to actually look for . 
0	i bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central .  i was actually really looking forward to watching this .  my god where did i go wrong ?  now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies ,  hell i own over 1 , 500 dvd's !  with that said ,  the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen .  i tried to give it a chance ,  but not only was it not funny .  it had no point ,  did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid .  god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny ?  this is going right to the bottom of the bin .  .  . 
0	i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from ,  what happens to them or where they are going .  i realize that hollywood's greatest pastime is navel-gazing ,  but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with .  for what it's worth ,  though ,  the discussion that followed the showing ,  under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series ,  did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics .  i disagree . 
0	i saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than caine believes ,  although it's not much cop .  britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role ,  which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing .  rex harrison seems even less bothered ,  perhaps unsurprisingly ,  as his character is very poorly written .  william holden is better ,  but his screen time is fleeting and ,  again ,  his character is not well scripted .   beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman as i have ever seen ,  but is given very little to do ,  the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story .  ustinov steals the show ,  but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone .  the music is poor and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos  ( his career has been based on this for decades now )  .   richard fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively ,  he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director ,  and this is one of his weaker movies . 
0	if you want to see a mystery ,  don't watch this .  though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory ,  this comes closer to an episode of  " dynasty "  ,  since the filmmaker focuses on  " character development "  - i . e .  long ,  boring talks between stupid ,  un-involving characters .  some people can make fascinating movies without real action  ( see  " exotica "  )  ,  but not this one .  avoid it ,  especially if you like the actors involved in this one . 
1	just saw the movie ,  and the scary thing was ,  the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors .  the movie had its moments ,  but also lagged and was rather sick .  it was all meant to be a farce ,  but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie ,  you think to yourself  " people like this are all around us "  all attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another .  on the plus side ,  there are some great  ( and funny )  insults .  i think i would wait for video- but it was a good laugh .  warning- jerry takes his shirt off during the movie !  !   ( not a pretty sight !  ) 
0	i saw this movie twice .  i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie .  i'm also a movie/theatre director and i know what i speak .  this is not romania anymore ,  but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september .  no story ,  no plot ,  nothing .  no conclusion ,  no message ,  nothing profound ,  nothing hidden .  just empty images .   what most of romanians don't know ,  this movie is for the french viewers ,  not for us .  they really believe that is the reality in romania .  also for teenagers .  pintilie should stop making movies .  i don't really know if we can call this a movie ,  maybe a horror  :  )  and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe .  this was a reality ,  but isn't anymore .  a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said :   " you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu "  . 
1	generically speaking ,  fay grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in american movies ,  unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky parker posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious jeff goldblum .  they have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other ,  even radiating with charm when goldblum rolls off hartley's shamelessly epic info-dumps .  nevertheless ,  if one were to deconstruct fay grim ,  one would see many instances in which countless scenes could've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being .   this sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to hal hartley's henry fool ,  which was made ten years earlier .  it has title character posey forced by cia agent goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband ,  the predecessor's titular anti-hero .  available within them is information that could concede the safety of the united states .  fay first makes for paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clichés featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to following the girl to double-crosses to triple-crosses .   the primary appeal of it all for me is that it's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town .  in the original henry fool ,  posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life .  hartley's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s ,  but i do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent nearne sister out of her ,  giving her a terrific predicament ,  as he did to her character's brother ,  played by james urbaniak ,  in henry fool ,  as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of goldblum .   hartley ,  however ,  is simply riding on that fragmentary idea .  his plot ,  though complex and labyrinthine ,  true to the form of the spy film ,  it seems as if to be entirely capricious .  the reason i was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds ,  not to mention the presence of posey and goldblum .  the problem with the remainder of hartley's cast is that i cannot seem to become fond of the rest of them .  it has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters ,  but with how they don't seem to hold their own alongside them ,  though saffron burrows certainly comes close .  most of the scenes not involving posey or goldblum are far too light on their feet ,  stringing us along with info-dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes .  they are shot almost entirely in tiled angles ,  as if hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material .   liam aiken ,  however ,  playing the now teenage son of fay and henry ,  has a certain allure about him ,  seeming wise beyond his years ,  certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters .  perhaps hartley intended that ,  or maybe it's simply aiken's presence .  the problem with a hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there .  as scorsese said ,   " cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out .  "  one has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film . 
0	according to imdb ,  as well as to every other website that holds a review ;  this  " thing "  doesn't have a director .  well ,  that would surely explain a lot !  just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium .   " hardgore "  is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut ,  as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration .  horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well ,  so why not combine the two ?  here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who's committed to a mental asylum ,  and from the first night already ,  she's drawn into a network of drugs ,  psychedelic orgies ,  rape ,  torture and dildo-action .  really ,  a lot of dildo-action .  the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her ,  but she has her throat slit even the same night .  the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated ,  going from laughably un-scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks .  the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish ,  but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ?  leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body ,  but most of her co-stars  ( male & female )  are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls . 
0	quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well .  what is it ?  what is it about will smith that i just can't stand any longer ?  i guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an oscar .  i understand how bias this is ,  but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons i can't ever see him winning one .  he's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor .  he's just not .  i give him credit for trying so hard ,  and being able to cry at the drop of a hat .  that's about it .   seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me ,  right from the start .  the suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me in any way .  i wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide .  there were absolutely no surprises .  the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry .  also ,  i don't know her name ,  but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife .  woody harrelson had very limited screen time ,  but i'd say he stole the show whenever he was on .   all in all ,  just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot .  i couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people .  never once felt sorry for 'tim/ben' .  he killed himself with a jellyfish ?  was the only survivor in an 8 person accident ?  geewiz .  . didn't see any of that coming .  .  .   5/10 is pretty generous . 
1	a film i expected very little from ,  and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be .  roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good' ,  it is funny throughout ,  the characters are endearing and the pace is just right .   toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt ,  said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams .  he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny .  watch out for these two .   highly recommended . 
0	there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video :  it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud .  the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring .  just a notch above lowbrow  ( thanks to freeman and spacey ,  who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films )  ,  the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as justin timberlake's acting .  i hate to knock the guy ,  but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte ,  the better .   the movie isn't all bad .  .  . just mostly .  i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man .  he deserves it .  and ,  unlike his fellow musician and co-star ,  he can act .  kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well  ( you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery )  ,  and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars  ( out of ten .  .  . he's not that good )  .   when all is said and done ,  the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake .  it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters .  all in all ,  t's just plain boring .  that being said ,  rent this when you are suffering from insomnia . 
1	several years ago the navy kept a studied distance away from the making of  " men of honor ,  "  a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism .  ever eager to support films showing our navy's best side the u . s . s .  nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers ,  with supporting shore installations ,  were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage .  some of the movie was shot aboard the u . s . s .  belleau wood .   antwone fisher wrote the script for denzel washington's director's debut in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating fisher ,  played effectively and deeply by derek luke .   fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the u . s . s .  belleau wood  ( lha-3 )  ,  a front line helicopter assault platform .  fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men .  sent to the m . d .  as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding ,  fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist ,  revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality .   the story develops as fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest ,  an enlisted sailor named cheryl ,  played by a stunningly beautiful joy bryant .   fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers ,  however painful ,  in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior .   while all the main characters are black ,  this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings .  viola davis ,  a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films ,  is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom ,  mrs .  tate  ( novella nelson )  ,  who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the oscar for gut-churning brutality .   films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability  ( all that transference and counter-transference stuff )  but the earnestness of fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping .  it's a good story ,  well told .  period .   while set in the navy ,   " antwone fisher "  is not in any real sense a service story as was  " men of honor ,  "  an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person .  nor is it truly a film about blacks .  it's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and ,  as fisher says ,  being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still  " standing tall .  "  the persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor .   my only quibble is that washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander .  with all the navy support people listed in the end credits ,  someone should have told director washington that his character ,  like all naval officers below the rank of commander ,  is addressed as  " mister .  "  not a big criticism ,  is it ?   :  )   i don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters .  it deserves wide distribution .  derek luke may well get an oscar nomination .   8/10 .   
1	a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event .   i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie .   the production values .  hey ,  it's an independent movie ,  with a shoe-string budget ,  so ,  ya ,  it's going to look a bit cheesy  ( if your standard is a-list hollywood fare )  .  but ,  properly compared with other independent movies ,  this film is perfectly acceptable .  more important than acting style ,  costumes ,  and music is the narrative itself .  is the story compelling ?  do the dramatic moments work ?  does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax ?  the answer to all these questions is an unqualified  " yes .  "  as a side-note ,  the truly important technical stuff--continuity ,  sound ,  lighting--are fine .  the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship .   content value .  the message of the movie is superb .  when you consider how many ideas the movie-maker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes ,  you begin to appreciate his artistry .  he presents the message of salvation ,  the consequence of unbelief ,  the danger of backsliding ,  the truth of the rapture ,  and the threat of a world-dominating satanic government with flare ,  imagination ,  and--most importantly for an evangelical movie--with biblical accuracy .   the movie-maker is a good storyteller .  for example ,  he develops the message of salvation in two important ways :   ( 1 )  he shows us through action the reality of jesus christ's sacrifice for our sake .  this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo-keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies .  the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake-poison .  the poison is like sin ;  the cure is like christ's blood ,  shed on the cross .   ( 2 )  the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog .  he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ .  so ,  the movie-maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story .   as a side-note ,  the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation ,  couched in explicitly evangelical christian language ,  imagery ,  and theology is also perfectly acceptable .  to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd ;  it's akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport-wear .  what else would evangelical christian movie makers make ,  if not a film that states their case ?  also ,  the fact that the movie-maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is ,  again ,  perfectly acceptable .  the movie-maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably .  how do i know ?  i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 ;  it still lived in her memory thirty years later .  how many movies can you say that about ?  all around ,  a very enjoyable ,  thought-provoking show .  i plan on showing it to my teen group at church . 
1	***spoilers*** seething with hatred and revenge half breed zach provo ,  james coburn ,  had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape .  what provo want's more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process ,  during a wild shootout ,  killed his navajo wife :  the former pima county sheriff sam burgade ,  charlton heston .   making his escape after killing two prison guards provo makes his way towards yuma knowing that that's not just where burgade lives but where his his young daughter susan ,  barbara hershey , resides as well .  using his fellow escaped convicts to lure burgade into the vast arizona desert ,  by promising them $30 , 000 . 00 in gold coins that he buried there ,  provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on burgade .  but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are ,  in not being with a woman for years ,  as horny as a rabbit during mating season !   brutal and very effective western that updates the john wayne 1956 classic  " the searchers "  in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter .  charlton heston as the guilt-ridden sam burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff .  charles coburn as the vengeful half breed zach provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict .   the man who escaped with provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice ,  in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand ,  but to go along with him .  it's only the thought of them having their way with susan ,  when provo gives them the green light ,  as well as the buried $30 , 000 . 00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way .   also going along with burgade is susan's boyfriend hal brickman ,  chris mitchum ,  who proves in the end that he's as good as burgade is ,  who felt that he just didn't have it in him ,  in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense ,  which in this case burgade lacks ,  in doing it .   ***spoilers**** the unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between burgade and provo is almost too much to sit through .  provo who's hatred of burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death .  it was that hatred that bugrade took advantage of and ,  after taking some half dozen bullets ,  thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty ,  as well as mindless ,  lunatic away for good ! 
0	note to horror fans :  the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting .   i watched this because :   the premise sounded slightly promising :  it's not .  it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either .    the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful :  it's not .  it's so not .  the amateur cinematography makes sure the  " fallen angels "  are about as sexy as the average homeless person .   the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre :  he's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting .  come to think of it ,  savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie .  it's not that he's bad ,  but he's almost always in bad movies .  his only good role was in from dusk till dawn ,  and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since .   but let's focus on the positive :  forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie .    everything else is a negative .  obviously the writer is allergic to originality .  the script is terrible .  that's all a given after the first 10 minutes .  but the clueless pacing ;  the way the director treats  " plot "  and  " characterization "  as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway ;  and the excruciatingly long and boring driving ,  walking ,  and nature sequences  ( no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution )  show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general .   this is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad :  if it's written and directed by the same person ,  expect garbage . 
0	like a relative that gives you a bad gift ,  soul survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution .  stephen carpenter's writing/directing effort borrows freely from other ,  better films ,  such as jacob's ladder and abre los ojos  ( open your eyes )  .  for those who haven't seen either of these films ,  i won't give the premise away ;  suffice to say it's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films .   melissa sagemiller stars as cassie ,  about to go away to college .  her current boyfriend sean  ( ben affleck )  and ex-boyfriend matt  ( wes bentley )  ,  both friends ,  and annabel  ( acerbic eliza dushku )  are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers  (  ?  )  in transparent masks .  she survives the wreck ,  but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear ,  leaving her in a state of total confusion :  who is dead ?  who's alive ?  what's real ?   soul survivors has the look of a bad been-there ,  done-that ,  gore-filled ,  blood-splattered ,  body-stacking teen exploitation flick .  true ,  it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes  ( plentiful ,  repetitive ,  and mind-numbing )  ,  but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches ,  unfortunately rather unsuccessfully .  it breeds confusion much more often than cohesion ,  as the story becomes jumbled ,  messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery  ( predictable as it is .  )   horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count .  credit goes to carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick ;  too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller .  sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance ,  actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling cassie .  it's great the filmmakers try something different ,  but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment .   4 out of 10
0	i really like slasher movies , but this one is truly awful . the acting is lame , the script is bad , and the atmosphere is non-existent . the plot is as follows : a deformed gardener charlie puckett slaughters people in a small american town . that's right-this is the plot . very original , eh !  " the night brings charlie "  isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary , at least they should make it bloody . avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs . if you want to see some good slasher flicks check out  " madman "  ,  " the burning "  ,  " the prowler "  ,  " just before dawn "  or  " humongous " - just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage . 
0	final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas ,  shooting people who shoot people .  then he's off to malta where he shoots more people .  he gets locked up many times for shooting people .  then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy ,  who is dressed like a monk .  there is a boat chase ,  and joe don winds up in jail again .  finally joe don ,  with the help from elaine from  " seinfeld "  kill the bad guy ,  blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare .  all this and a catchy theme song ,  just like mitchell ! 
1	the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing ,  with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright  ( yet volatile )  lights of broadway filled with typically naïve optimism .  of course ,  their first attempt fails and kermit  ( leader of the group and author of the show )  blows his top ;  so ,  the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them .  kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner  ( the old man ,  then ,  has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs !  )  .  we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars :  art carney  ( as a producer )  ,  james coco  ( as an overzealous dog owner )  ,  dabney coleman  ( as a confidence trickster )  ,  elliott gould  ( who was also in the muppet movie [1979] )  ,  gregory hines ,  liza minnelli  ( as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermit's ,  sporting fake moustache ,  as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets' show )  ,  brooke shields ,  and even director john landis  ( in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig !  )  .  the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces ,  with  ( regrettably )  less space given to gonzo this time around ;  while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me ,  the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny .  what disappoints ,  however ,  is the climactic show itself  ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue )  which ,  rather than the expected splashy routines ,  procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy ! 
1	excellent story about teenagers ,  leaders ,  high school football  " stars "  .  how far will you go to protect your friends ?  lie ,  kill ?  how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl ?  can love beat the odds ?  can you defeat narrow-minded small town people ?  when your friend scores and you  " lose "  ,  will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it ,  or will you be a man about it ,  and respect her right to chose ?  will you rape her and show it as your victory over a  " problem "  girl ?  can you stand by the one who's only sin is to have an opinion of her own ,  to be able to make her own decisions ,  to chose for herself ?  it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong ,  but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general .  thumb up ! 
0	i enjoy quality crapness ,  and this ranks up there with some of the finest .  the cg is out of this world ,  or at least pre-dates our world ,  and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad .  i quite enjoyed some of this ,  but the acting is so goddamn awful ,  and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it .  just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one .  i don't know who wasted more time ,  me watching this ,  or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers .  i can assure you ,  it wont .  however ,  on a brighter note ,  i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie ,  so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it . 
0	oh dear ,  oh dear .  i started watching this not knowing what to expect .  i couldn't believe what i was seeing .  there were times when i thought it was a comedy .  i loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man ,  who is unarmed ,  and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack .  if only it were really that easy .  i've finally found a movie worse than  " plan 9 from outer space "  . 
1	i didn't approach  " still crazy "  with any real anticipation .  just another rock'n'roll picture ,  i figured .  .  .  good nostalgia for the baby boomers .  this film is partially that ,  but so much more .  brian gibson ,  the director ,  previously helmed a biography of tina turner ,  and is quite successful in his style .  i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film .   the cast is well-chosen .  bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band's frontman .  actor-turned-director bruce robinson appears as the band's washed-up guitarist .  he does a superb job ,  even though he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's .  if you're looking for an touching and funny film  ( with some great songs )  ,  you've found it .   7 . 4 out of 10
0	bob clampett's 'porky's poor fish' is a so-so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments .  set in porky's fish shoppe ,  'porky's poor fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black 'n' white porky cartoon and one of the books-come-to-life merrie melodies that were popular at that time .  typically of many of the early porky cartoons ,  porky is far from the star ,  appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film .  for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for .  unfortunately ,  the audience gets far less than they bargained for .  as was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series ,  the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium .  laughs are scarce and ,  while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett's energetic direction ,  there is very little at all to recommend 'porky's poor fish' over any of the other below-par early porky cartoons . 
1	a new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor james stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director anthony mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future .  until that time stewart was mainly noted for an aw .  . aw .  . aw approach to family oriented comedies ,  dramas ,  and romances .  not that he wasn't already a multi-talented hollywood star .  one of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as macaulay 'mike' connor ,  a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in  " the philadelphia story .  "  he had even done westerns before .  his portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot thomas jefferson destry jr .  in the comedy western  " destry rides again "  helped make that film a classic .  but to most movie goers he was the all-american boyscout type mr .  smith or george bailey .  seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played .    anthony mann was associated with b flicks in the film noir mode .   " raw deal ,  "   " side street ,  "  and  " t-men "  caught the eye of james stewart .  so the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest hollywood westerns ever made .   " winchester '73 "  and  " the man from laramie "  were the best but the others were almost as effective .  mann became a successful director of a films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all gary cooper's  " man of the west .  "  stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid ,  a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on .   winchester '73 was also one of the first films ,  maybe the first ,  to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun .  each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie ,  which also holds a surprise for the viewer .  based on a story by stuart lake ,  the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the winchester '73 .  the year is 1876 .  custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the sioux and cheyenne at little big horn .  the whites want revenge .  the native americans want their land and their way of life back .  this conflict leads to a confrontation between native americas led by young bull  ( young rock hudson showing his potential as an actor )  and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians lin mcadam  ( stewart )  ,  his partner and life-long pal high spade  (  the underrated actor millard mitchell )  ,  and a couple trying to find themselves ,  steve miller  ( charles drake )  and lola manners  ( shelley winters )  ,  a soiled dove with a kind heart .  among the horse soldiers are newcomers tony curtis and james best  ( late of the  " dukes of hazzard "  )  ,  whose part is cut short by a bullet .   wyatt earp was in dodge city in 1876 .  the movie has him as head marshal .  the fine actor will geer  ( later of the waltons )  looks like an older earp .  in reality wyatt was assistant marshal in dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman .  lin mcadam wins the winchester in a shooting contest ,  but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw dutch henry brown  ( stephen mcnally )  and his henchmen .  mcadam and high spade are after both dutch henry and the winchester for the remainder of the movie .  an even more sinister character emerges along the way ,  waco johnnie dean ,  played as evil personified by dan duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast .   the winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film ,  each time the transfer is intense .  one involves a gunrunner played to perfection by john mcintire .  other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above .  all this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show .   as noted above ,  the cast is first rate down to the smallest role .  look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts ,  including the future sheriff of  " bonanza "  ray teal and b western reliable panhandle perkins  ( guy wilkerson )  . 
1	when i first heard about the show ,  i heard a lot about it ,  and it was getting some good reviews .  i watched the first episode of this  " forensic fairy tale "  ,  as it so proclaims itself ,  and i really got hooked on it .  i have loved it since .  this show has a good sense of humour and it's fun to see a good show like this .  the cast is excellent as their characters ,  and i wouldn't want to change them in any way .   for those unfamiliar with this show ,  pushing daisies centers around a man named ned  ( aka the pie maker ,  played by lee pace )  who discovered a special gift when he was a boy :  he could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger .  he first did so with his dog ,  digby .  however ,  there is the catch :  if he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute ,  someone else dies .  he learned this when he brought his mother back to life ,  and his childhood crush's father died in ned's mother's place .  the other catch is if he touches the person again ,  they're dead again ,  but this time for good .  he learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight .  his father took him to boarding school ,  and when he left ,  ned never saw his father again .   almost 20 years later ,  ned owns a pie bakery ,  cleverly titled  " the pie hole .  "  a co-worker of ned's ,  olive snook  ( kristin chenoweth )  has a crush on ned ,  but ned rejects her moves ,  trying not to get close to anyone ,  learning from past experiences .  private investigator emerson cod  ( chi mcbride )  discovered the gift that ned has ,  and decides to make him a partner in solving murders .  ned touches the victim ,  asks who killed them ,  and when the minute is up ,  he touches them again ,  and they solve it .  that's how they usually solve it .  throughout the episodes ,  the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect .   one day ,  ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart ,  charlotte  " chuck "  charles  ( anna friel )  .  he brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive .  in her place ,  the funeral director ,  who stole jewelery from the corpses ,  died .  when emerson finds out ,  and when chuck wants to help with solving the murders ,  he doesn't agree a bit--for a while ,  we hear him call chuck 'dead girl' .  this is all kept in secret from olive ,  chuck's aunts vivian and lily  ( ellen greene and swoosie kurtz ,  respectively )  ,  and everyone else for that matter ,  in case anyone recognized her from obituaries ,  the news ,  etc .  vivian and lily ,  formerly synchronized swimmers ,  hadn't left the house in years .  emerson ,  ned ,  and chuck agree to work together .  ned and chuck grow to love each other ,  though they can't touch each other ever again .   this show is funny ,  has terrific characters ,  contains great plot twists ,  and will definitely get your spirits up .  i hope it doesn't get cancelled at 13 episodes . 
0	be warned !    this is crap that other crap won't even deign to be in company with because it's beneath them !  okay ,  got that out of the way ,  let me say something more substantive .   i've seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director ,  wong kar wai .  well ,  despite of all of that wkw hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans ;  mostly it is just shots of dripping water ,  beads of sweats ,  legs of horses running ,  etc .  i couldn't sit through most of the movie .   fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr .  wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises ,  especially from cannes .  i was intrigued by his latest ,  2046 .  a friend told me to start w/ chungking express because it is his most accessible movies .  so wrong !  i was just p . o .  that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness .  some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah .  it's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it .  but no ,  he merely shows what is .  faye wong's acting is very typical of hong kong's style :  garbled enunciation ,  deer in the headlight wide eye expression ,  try to be cute and girlish kind of acting ;  the rest of the cast is equally uninspired .   i think the word ,  auteur ,  is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different ,  which is to be applauded ,  but not one who hasn't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling ,  which is what mr .  wong is ,  for the last 17 years ! 
1	an unconventional historical drama ,  with some fine battle scenes .  tobey maguire gives an excellent performance ,  and gets some pretty good back-up .  the script is literate and pretty original ,  and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes .  that said ,  it does drag a bit ,  and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series .  still ,  frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits  ( and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch )  .  worth seeing . 
1	walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema .  how do you get laughs out of other people's misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long ?   well ,  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs ,  beautiful scenery ,  and quite a good buzz as well .  i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it ,  and marijuana illegal ,  since 'those other races' used it .  .  . undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world .   an extraordinary  " dvd extra "  commentary .  .  . two of them in fact .  .  . run thru the whole movie with both the actors ,  and then again with the writers .  i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie ,  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take .  what a hoot !  don't miss it !  9/10 stars
0	this was a movie about infidelity and revenge .  a twin with the  " twin "  connection senses that something is wrong with her sister .  this movie took forever to establish the plot .  a plot that has been done many times .  the acting was lousy for the most part .  once the plot comes together ,  the movie ends .  laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father .  the father seems to favor ashley ,  so laura gets the blame for everything .  there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart ,  but as they grow up ,  their lives go in different directions .  ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry ,  a married man .  of course no good can come of this .  the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down .  i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere ,  but it never happened . 
1	i simply never tire of watching freebird .  my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start .  have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release .  even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout france .  freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting .  only phil daniels could fit the role of grouch .  great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party following the premier in january .  anything else you want doing jon just ask ,  either email or phone ,  you know how to get me .  sue xx
1	although this was obviously a low-budget production ,  the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing .  one of walken's few musical roles to date .   ( he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel !  )  also starring jason connery .  a great children's story and very likable characters . 
0	this type of plot really does have a lot of potential ,  but it was butchered here .  honestly ,  i sensed the cheese element in the beginning ,  but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing .  whoa ,  i was wrong !  so mad scientist makes a monster ,  wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them ,  but of course they escape .  after that ,  it's really bad .  i should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage ,  but i most likely would have lost count .   pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks .  i hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film .   oh ,  and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island ,  there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting shakespeare .  .  .   this is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster .  .  .  if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick . 
0	well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview ,  else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie .  i mean haven't we had enough of this yet ?  scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious !  the plot sucks ,  and the acting is the worst i've seen .   ( only godzilla can compare ,  which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one .  )   there is so many plot holes in the story ,  and the girls are so alike ,  that you don't even now who has been killed ,  and who has not .   ( and you don't care .  )  the only of them i knew in advance was denise ,  and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie .   stay as far away from this movie as possible .   ( 2/10 ) 
1	diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest .  i say that because we were entranced by the brief ,  five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms .   ostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment .  having only been in paris several times ,  i was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the city's locations .  in any event ,  the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in-consequence .   the film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen .  the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense ,  they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell ,  sell .  sell  .  .  .   go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed . 
1	okay ,  i'll admit it--i am a goof-ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy .  while i have seen more films by kurosawa ,  bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet ,  i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny .  a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail ,  uhf ,  start the revolution without me ,  strange brew and the bill and ted movies .  they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them .   while bill & ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film ,  it still is great fun .  also ,  unlike the original ,  it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing .  i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs .  but ,  every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the grim reaper .  and ,  by the way ,  this reaper is about as different from bergman's in the seventh seal as you can get !  !  in addition to a lot of laughs ,  this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film .  the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes--provided you aren't an old killjoy like de nomolos .  great viewing for kids and adults alike . 
0	we loved school of rock and jack black .  we couldn't wait to go and see this movie .  it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out .  my husband hated it too .  the only funny parts were in the trailers .  my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money .  the writing was awful .  it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended .  the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity .  the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry .  i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts ,  but there weren't .  save you money and your time . 
1	there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life  ( not only in japan ,  but everywhere )  .  it shows how stifling ones culture can be ,  and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you .   the dancing was just a vehicle for saying  " do what you love even if its against the norm "  .  rather billy elliot like i would say .  i enjoyed that film as well .    the humour was well timed ,  and the touching moments felt so real ,  you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife ,  the tantrums in the dance hall .  i loved aoki - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl !   the actors all did a wonderful job ,  the story was well written .  i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing .  good entertainment ! 
1	this movie is brilliant in every way .  it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way ,  but never lectures .  the script never condescends toward any character ,  not even the hapless johnny .  it also and benefits from spot-on direction ,  production design ,  casting ,  and performances .  the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike  " cher "  than she has ever been is a wonder to me .  i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well .  it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end . 
0	i am not saying that night of the twisters was horrible ,  but it was far from great .  mediocre at absolute best .  i seems though that every time one type of movie is released ,  a second must be around the same time .   ( think about armageddon and deep impact ,  volcano and dante's peak )  night of the twisters is really just twister except worse and with mundane special effects .   i have nothing against the actors who starred in it ,  even if they weren't great ,  it was the movie itself ,  the directing ,  the special effects ,  the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret .  a series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage .   i really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other ,  but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt . 
0	this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life .  just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history ,  along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene .  i think the transvestite poodles did it for me ,  or better yet ,  her talking tongue .  .  . or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat .  decisions ,  decisions .  .  . 
1	excellent movie ,  a realistic picture of contemporary finland ,  touching and profound .  one of the best finnish films ever made .  captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town ,  people's desires and weaknesses ,  joys and sorrows .  the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society .  lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers .  he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed .  his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki . 
0	i saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently ,  on one of those dollar dvd's that seem to be everywhere nowadays ,  and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself .  for those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable mexican import ,  and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone else's jaundiced commentary ,  there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows .  so if you are one of those reckless individuals ,  stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself .  if you get drunk enough in advance ,  you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it's over .   begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti .  no one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of cross-species implantation could occur ,  and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical .  but pour yourself another glass of wine  ( or whatever you're drinking )  ,  and let us proceed .   paul naschy  ( our werewolf )  has the look of a man fighting a toothache ,  in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey ,  and has been drunk ever since .   ( ain't he the lucky one ?  )  naschy's facial expression never varies ,  whether in or out of makeup ,  and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf .  occasionally he tries to imitate the lon chaney jr .  crouch ,  but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt ,  like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair .  to be fair ,  the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it ,  but the continuity is infinitely worse .  naschy's werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl .  he goes from black shirt to red shirt ,  then back to black ,  then back to red ,  then back to black ,  all in a single ,  frenzied night .  interestingly enough ,  he always does the chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt ,  and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt .  and it's only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title .  presumably there's something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him .   so anyway ,  after being bitten by the cross-pollinating yeti ,  the poor schmuck returns home from tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students .  the two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car .  he survives the wreck ,  and makes it home just in time for a full moon .  then ,  after chewing up his wife and her lover ,  he wanders off again ,  and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted .  but is that enough ?  can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace ?  not a chance .  he is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore s/m fetish ,  otherwise known as  " the doctor "   ( and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who )  .  she digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle ,  takes him down to the dungeon ,  chains him to the wall ,  and gives him a damn good flogging .  presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfman .   after his two-shirted rampage ,  our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle ,  trying to find a way out .   ( and who can blame him ?  )  in the course of his wanderings ,  he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichés ,  including a man dressed in medieval armor ,  a curiously inept phantom of the opera impersonator  ( supposedly the doctor's father )  ,  and a hard-partying cadre of bondage slaves .   so what's it all about ,  one may reasonably ask ?  one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control ,  and involves something the doctor calls  " chemotrodes .  "   ( best guess .  i really have no idea how it's spelled ,  if there even is such a thing .  )  mercifully ,  the experiment ends in failure ,  and most importantly ,  it ends .  .  . before one has time to gnaw one's own leg off .   of course ,  one doesn't really expect any sense from a film like this ,  but at least it ought to be good for laughs .  this one isn't .  forget it ,  buddy .  there is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film ,  from its patched-together ,  tequila-drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score ,  that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any mst3k type laughs out of it .  if it's not even good for that ,  what the hell is it good for ?  if montezuma's revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a dvd ,  it would have looked exactly like this movie . 
0	so ,  i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star .  i hated it .  it was so stupid and unrealistic ,  i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project .   james g .  and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too ,  but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover ,  but to just walk away .  .  . i don't even want to get into what the movie is about ,  because it is too stupid to pontificate about .   don't rent this !  it's horrible !  horrible ! 
1	this show started out with great mystery episodes .  i think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes .  after that ,  the show started playing short episodes with shaggy ,  scooby doo ,  and scrappy doo .   i think hanna barbera productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes .  some of the voice actors became unavailable .  after 15 or 16 episodes ,  frank welker  ( who played fred )  became unavailable .  i think the voice of velma changes after first 12 episodes ,  because the first voice actress who played velma was unavailable .   and the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy ,  scooby doo ,  and scrappy doo ,  because the ratings were high .  so they had to make more shorts .  i wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes .  still it is a good show . 
1	when i first saw this film on cable ,  it instantly became one of my favorite movies .  i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall .  the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes .  most of the attitudes came from soll ,  an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor .  soll is what makes the move ,  his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then .  i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease .  none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex .  while he has racist views ,  he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black .  the two convicts he trusts most are jackson ( mel winkler )  and ben ( james earl jones )  .  the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie ,  they have real chemistry .  james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass .   this movie should have gotten more notoriety .  however it's on dvd and worth the money .   rayvyn
0	i cannot stand this show !  has there ever been even one redeeming quality ,  one funny punchline ,  or one plot line that  " didn't "  make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes ?    the voices .  oh ,  those horrible ,  wretched voices .  akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard ,  each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill ,  nasal vocals .  cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel ,  vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew ,  and timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host  ( guy smiley from  " sesame street "  comes to mind )  .   the animation is awful ;  even the producers of  " yu-gi-oh !  "  laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show .  every character has buck teeth ,  or a square head ,  or a head three sizes too big for his or her body .  and what's with having the characters speak every single line wide-eyed and grinning ,  as though posing for a photo op with the president ?  then ,  there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic .  not since the subtle grace of amelia bedelia ,  homer simpson ,  and buddy lembeck of  " charles in charge "  fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb .  usually  " unrealistic "  is synonymous with  " unfunny "  ,  and that is most definitely the case here .  there hasn't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since  " the naked gun 33 1/3 "  .  .  . and at least leslie nielson was good at it .   finally ,  the premise of the show  ( and it's the same every single episode ,  so big time spoiler alert here )  :  timmy wishes for something with his two  " fairly oddparents "  ,  something goes wrong ,  there's always some contrived reason why he can't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage ,  and then everything turns out just fine in the end .  oh ,  and on a side note ,  timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about vicky ,  and they continue to employ her at every opportunity .  maybe it's just me ,  but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn't a great idea .    if you're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen ,   " the fairly odd parents "  has to be a great place to start .  a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it . 
0	what reviewers and mst3k left out is the best part  ( and only memorable scene )  of this otherwise dreadful movie :  there is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene committed by the bad guy  ( ben gazzara look-alike )  on maria  ( as mentioned ,  killed later through t . j . 's ineptitude )  .  perhaps rape is too strong a word ,   " prison mating ritual "  may be more appropriate .  the background behind this chance ,  yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding  " ben gazzara ,  "  introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool .  the 30-ish blonde disses him ,  but our villain must be quite smitten by her ,  because the courtship is on at that point .  his first move is to attempt drowning her ,  until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off .  kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like ,  but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway .  .  .  let's just say ,  he catches up with her in the cabana later . 
0	i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks ,  which i thought was pretty good .  .  . i was right .  .  . in all honesty i thought it could have been better .  .  . sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me .  .  . the acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much better .  .  . this movie i'd say is for teens and the young of heart ;  full of female bodies ,  alcohol and sex .  .  . it's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again .  4/10 is my vote for this one . 
0	i just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival .  the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out .  i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed .   besides being poorly written ,  it was boring .  i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script .   first bite was cliché without being ironic ,  over the top seriousness without being funny .  the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel .  instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film .  i can't recommend this film .  it felt too long and all in all just plain weak . 
1	i love this film 'spring and port wine' .  i was born in leigh ,  a town about 7 miles away from bolton ,  i moved to bolton in 1965 when i was 20 .  my place of work was daily via little lever through farnworth ,  sometimes on a bike but then by car when i could afford it . the film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could .  fred dibnah was round the corner from bromwich st .  were my bedsit was .  if you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as coronation st ,  well i agree it is a soap ,  but then ,  it was called 'kitchen sink drama ! ' watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on tv ,  i watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy ! 
1	some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough .  well ,  if you regard it as an action movie ,  this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting .  however ,  i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one .   the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences .  tomas beccket  ,  who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills ,  looked as if he was cold-hearted .  however ,  after beccket showed his day dream of montana ,  we can clearly see his softness inside .  it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted .   millar ,  on the contrary ,  was a new comer ,  a green hand ,  and was even not qualified as a sniper .  billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to  " put a bullet through one's heart "  ( as what beccket said )  .  what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award .   these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities .  these two snipers quarreled ,  suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other .   sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one . 
1	i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd  ( yay !  )  it's striking me as fresh ,  as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired .   the central performances are gripping ,  the scripts are layered .   i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035 .   i've been asked to write some more line  ( it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever !  pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way .  )   well ,  unlike imdb's submissions editors ,  american gothic understands that simplicity is everything .   in 22 episodes ,  the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons .  on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation .   when the show first aired ,  i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off .  personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years .  reckon it don't get more controversial than that ! 
1	although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor  ( zombi 2 )  i actually like this one better .  this is because of it's faster pace ,  better settings ,  and cool 80's soundtrack .  it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci .  the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good .  it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness ;  for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas .  some are braindead while others say funny lines ,  but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror ?  there's even a flying zombie head !  how rad is that ?  definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans .  it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well .  also check out zombi 4 . 
0	istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that errol flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the irs .  it's a remake of the fred macmurray- ava gardner film singapore from a decade ago .   unlike that studio product ,  istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the golden horn .  but errol flynn ,  who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film ,  was way too old to be playing these action/adventure types any longer .  his scenes with cornell borchers really do lack conviction .   as for cornell ,  she plays errol's former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia .  she both doesn't remember errol and is now married to torin thatcher .    but errol's got some nasty people led by martin benson and werner klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession .  got to deal with them too .   best reason to see istanbul is to hear nat king cole sing and play the piano .  most people today don't realize that cole was an accomplished jazz pianist ,  they only think of him as a singer .  actually he was a pianist first ,  the singing was an afterthought .   istanbul is a routine action/adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie . 
0	i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film .  look at it a month later and you might see it differently ,  or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first .  after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere ,  it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself .  shane danielsen  ( artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival )  ,  aided by the film's director and producer ,  gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience .  edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked .  only one person walked out in disgust .  the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m . a .  film directors .  this was not an overly 'shocking' film .  there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence ,  but far less extreme than many movies  ( most actual weapon contact was obscured ,  as were aroused genitals )  .  the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring ,  where the acting standards were not high ,  where the plot was poor ,  predictable and drawn out ,  and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie .  metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived ,  over-emphasised and sloppy  ( apart from a general allusion to violence ,  any deeper meaning is unclear )  ;  and the 'fig-leaf' reference marquis de sade ,  as one audience member put it ,  seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale .   we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him  ( he stands out at school for his musical ability )  but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence .  when pushed ,  robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him .   the film is not entirely without merit .  the audience is left to decide how robert got that way :  was it the influence of his peers ?  why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life ?  cinematically ,  there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back  ( whether through too much drugs ,  shyness ,  a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn ?  )  .  several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room ,  partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen .  in the foreground of the bare bones flat ,  a dj is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman .  ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention .  the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way .  robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground .   but the rest of the film ,  including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable  ( if not overly realistic )  sexual violence ,  is not up to this standard .  some people have had a strong reaction to it  ( the filmmakers' stated intention :   " if they vomit ,  we have succeeded in producing a reaction "  )  but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel ,   " why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making ?  "  director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision .  his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet ,  even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms ,  but unfortunately they do not apply to his film ,  any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates ,  or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols .  wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt ,  i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening ,  but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial .  there are many truths .  one aspect of art is to educate ,  another to entertain ,  another to inspire .  i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach  ( one of the many great names he takes in vain )  without going so far as to admit any agenda himself .  he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth .  i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director ,  or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work  andy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art .  clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries .  sadly ,  his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuses for a publicity-seeking film . 
1	 " october sky "  is a film that will steal your heart ,  fill your mind with vivid imagery ,  and lift your spirit .  the tale of homer hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first ,  especially when the film is set in a mining town ,  where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine .  but homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps .  with the encouragement of miss riley ,  ( a friendly teacher )  ,  members of his father's staff ,  and his friends ,  homer attempts to make his dream a reality .   yet as in any true to life story ,  there are many stops along the way .  director joe johnston lowers us into the coal mines ,  where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock .  with lit helmets and bent posture ,  they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness .  the hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work .   contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of homer and his friend's rocket launches .  underneath the blue bowl of sky ,  rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere .  .  . and nothing can match the scene when homer sees sputnik for the first time .   yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters .  homer's father is a classic hardened man .  .  . but he has a soft side as well .  we see that he does love his son ,  despite their many arguments .  the love and support of miss riley is evident as well .  best of all ,  the film is uncomfortable .  it doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow .  it tears at you ,  lifts you up .  it keeps an air of reality ,  which is important in a film like this .   this film can be considered a complete work .  at first ,  i was disappointed that the film did not continue with homer's life .  i didn't want it to end .  then i realized .  .  . that's what a good film does to a person .  if it has done its job ,  you won't want it to end .  and  " october sky "  accomplishes just that . 
0	come on ,  what is the deal with this show ,  power rangers anyways ?  i always felt that the show ,  which was originally brought over from japan in a better form ,  took what was great in japan ,  and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history !  there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever .   the bad haircuts ,  bad costumes ,  earrings ,  etc ,  all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots ,  bulk and skull ,  to the  " duhs "  ,  of the main cast ,  jason ,  trini ,  tommy ,  kimberly ,  billy and zack ,  i just want to say one thing :  give me a break !   saban brought this from japan ,  and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago .   now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such .   all i can say once again is give me a break ! 
1	i am a very big jim carrey fan .  i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura .  i also like him in his serious movies ,  especially truman show .  this one is a cross between his very funny side ,  and his serious side .  he is of course very funny in this movie ,  but there are parts that are very serious ,  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease .  he is truely a multi-function actor .   as for the rest of the cast ,  i was happy with jennifer aniston's acting .  i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass .  morgan freeman makes a very cool god .  as for steven carell ,  his limited scenes are very funny ,  especially in the anchor scene .   overall ,  i would have to rate this a 9 .  good acting ,  funny script ,  and some very serious situations make this a very good film . 
1	the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead' ,  a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment ,  a soft pillow for your head ;  may you be 40 years in heaven ,  before the devil knows you're dead . ' first time screenwriter kelly masterson  ( with some modifications by director sidney lumet )  has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes .  in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but ,  here ,  very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling .  by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale ,  we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong .    andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  is a wealthy executive ,  married to an emotionally needy gina  ( marisa tomei )  ,  and addicted to an expensive drug habit .  his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money .  andy's ne're-do well younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha  ( amy ryan )  ,  is behind in alimony and child support ,  and has borrowed all he can from his friends ,  and he needs money .  andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe ,  quick cash for both .  the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - charles  ( albert finney )  and nanette  ( rosemary harris )  .  andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery ,  but though hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan ,  he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car .  the robbery is horribly botched when nanette ,  filing in for the regular clerk ,  shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess .  the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies ,  charles and andy and hank  ( and their respective partners )  are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn .    each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances ,  and while we have come to expect that from hoffman ,  hawke ,  tomei ,  finney ,  ryan ,  and harris ,  it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful .  it is not an easy film to watch ,  but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect ,  a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be .  grady harp
0	having loved 'paris ,  je t'aime' ,  i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations ,  but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons .   although ,  i was not expecting a re-make of 'paris' in new york i was expecting the same structure .  what i liked about 'paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods .  you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell .  in 'ny' ,  there is no clear separation of the stories ,  at different points in the film ,  characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on .  also ,  the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow .   another thing i loved about the 'paris' film was the different takes on love .  it wasn't all romantic .  there was love between parents and their children ,  unrequited love ,  a lonely ,  middle-aged woman yearning for love etc .  ,  it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans .  'ny' seemed to only go for an edgy ,  over-the-top sexuality .  there were some redeemable shorts  ( the older couple having spent a lifetime together ,  julie christie's short )  ,  but overall the'ny' film didn't evoke any emotion for me .  i didn't connect with any of the characters like i did with 'paris' .  i remember watching 'paris' and feeling a deep sadness ,  loneliness ,  yearning ,  hopefulness ,  wonder .  .  .  it just had so much soul .  for me ,  there was no soul in the 'ny' film .   maybe if i had gone into it without having 'paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response ,  but as a self-titled re-take of 'paris ,  je t'aime' i was sorely disappointed . 
0	the film is poorly casted ,  except for some familiar old hollywood names .  other performances by unknown names  ( i . e .  ,  jennifer gabrielle )  are uninspiring .  i have seen other films by this director ,  unfortunately this is one of his worst .  perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay ?    in a positive note ,  kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion .  i enjoyed pat more in karate kid ,  though .  there are many good movies to see ,  and in short ,  this one is not one of them .  save your money and the celluloid .    jason vanness
1	atlantis was much better than i had anticipated .  in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age .  although this film did demand a soid attention span at times .  it was a great film for all ages .  i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure .  i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies .  a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies .  after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis . 
1	brilliant !  my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival .  after seeing the film ,  i can understand why there was such a long line .  holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people .  she is a young girl ,  he is a worn out westerner .  the film grasped every bone in our body .  there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut .  the film is beautifully shot .  among others ,  we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle .  thuy ngoyen's rawness  ( cant believe this is her first acting job ) and ron livingston's performance stayed with me for a couple of days .  highly recommended . 
1	sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch !  she's beautiful ,  sexy ,  funny and talent ,  dark and demonic .  i read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it .  nothing that appears on t . v .  is an accident .  too much money ,  time and work is put into the production of a t . v .  show for there to be mistakes .  this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid .  this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile .  i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre .  it's a lot like pee-wee's playhouse for maladjusted ,  slacker twenty-something glue sniffing ,  future pornstars of america from the valley .  the cast is awesome .  the scenarios and action is well-paced .  i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn't let david spade keep his show .  who plays sarah's sister ?  she not in the cast listing on the show's home page .  i would love to see her stand-up .  does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there ? 
0	before seeing this movie ,  please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events ,  particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8 , 000 muslim men were bused out of srebrenica and shot by serbian paramilitaries .  the documentarian also belongs to various pro-serbian american organizations .  please watch this movie critically ,  and read reviews beforehand .  most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far ,  even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war .  a review in the nytimes by stephen holden states that it would be  " inaccurate to label this documentary pro-serbian ,  "  but one should question both the presentation of facts ,  many of which are taken from reliable sources ,  and the omission of those facts that inculpate serbian forces .  i do not advise against seeing this documentary ,  but i do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye  ( as one should do at all times anyway )  . 
1	a very interesting entertainment ,  with the charm of the old movies .  tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it ,  and we all enjoy with him his success . the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills  ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout ) 
1	this is the second film i've seen of ida lupino as a director after 53's the hitch-hiker .  i think this one was a better film then that one .  this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family .  i think leonard maltin's review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 stars . 
0	 " the cobweb "  is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong ,  sometimes noteworthy performances and high points ,  but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience .  it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all .   the plot is preposterous .  its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows .  one old woman wants to have her drapes put over them ,  but a lot of the patients want to make their own .  and somehow ,  this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart .  it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children .   the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it .  don't get me wrong ,  there's nothing wrong with the acting .  the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors ,  many of them academy award-nominees and winners .  and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly ,  but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes .  unfortunately ,  there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus ,  the movie slows down .  a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint ,  adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest .   in a short analysis ,   " the cobweb "  is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus ,  which it does pretty quickly .  it just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch . 
1	the movie was excellent ,  save for some of the scenes with esposito .  i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series ,  and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series  ( thanks to nbc .  .  .  )  .  it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human ,  and most basic persons .  braugher and secor did a great job ,  but as usual will get overlooked .  it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide .  memories ,  tapes ,  and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday .  but the movie did its job and did it very well ,  presenting a great depiction of life after al retired ,  and the family relationship that existed between the unit .  i enjoyed this a lot . 
1	tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster ,  tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting .   underground introduced the storymode ,  which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans .  another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard ,  which is nice because now you can actually climb ,  run ,  and do all sorts of new things .   the levels are good ,  neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs .  the first two games for the ps1 ,  n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some .  pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits .  in this version ,  they shortened those features ,  there isn't as many people wondering the streets ,  in fact there are almost none in some levels ,  and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot .   this game does have one con ,  the storymode is a little short ,  of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater ,  so that is understandable .  however ,  with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day .   overall ,  a great addition that was very refreshing . 
1	i think dark angel is great !  first season was excellent ,  and had a good plot .  with max ( jessica alba )  as an escaped x-5 ,  manticore creation ,  trying to adapt to a normal life ,  but still  " saving the world "  .  and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice .   the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first .  the plot kinda disappeared ,  and the series lost a little of it's charm ,  mostly because of all the weird  " creatures "  appearing .  don't get me wrong the second season is good ,  but with a little bit to much of the  " manticores "  .  however ,  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 ,  in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of .   so i really wish they could start making new episodes .  and with james cameron behind this it can't go wrong .  so as a conclusion i would say it's a great series ,  however i'm still hoping for a third season ! 
1	in manhattan ,  the american middle class jim blandings  ( cary grant )  lives with his wife muriel  ( myrna loy )  and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and one bathroom only leased apartment .  jim works in an advertising agency raising us$ 15 , 000 . 00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space .  when he sees an advertisement of a huge house for sale in the country of connecticut for an affordable price ,  he drives with his wife and the real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice .  his best friend and lawyer bill cole  ( melvyn douglas )  sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house ,  and the man tells that he should put down the house and build another one .  jim checks the information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner he finds that he bought a  " money pit "  instead of a dream house .    " mr .  blandings builds his own house "  is an extremely funny comedy ,  with witty lines and top-notch screenplay .  cary grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the american dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice ,  while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend .  in 1986 ,  tom hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic ,   " the money pit "  .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " lar ,  meu tormento "   (  " home ,  my torment "  ) 
0	 .  .  . is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire :  scandal ,  sex ,  celebrity ,  power .  kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in  " legally blonde .  "  the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him .  eddie izzard is pretty good ,  except that he's playing charlie chaplin ,  and is about ,  oh ,  125 lbs too heavy for the part ?  hard to believe this hamfisted ,  uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich ,  but then again ,  he hasn't made a watchable movie in ,  what ?  30 years ?  sometimes ,  there's just no coming back . 
0	this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever ,  i emphasize ,  ever made .  what´s worse ,  my old hero dolph is in it and he´s starring it .  jesus .  .  .  the story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt .  the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter .  the actors ,  except for dolph who kinda sucks also ,  perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director ,  who by the way must have been absent most ,  if not all ,  of the time .  this is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way ,  because by the look of the effects and scenery ,  the cost can´t be a cent above §1000 . 
0	first let me state that i do not believe in god  ( if you want to use the word atheist ,  fine ,  but i don't like that word since it describes what i'm not ,  not what i am )  but i hated this  " documentary .  "  the production values were damn near non existent ,  the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian flemming's insecurities .   the production values were terrible and brian flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best .  the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot ,  and he didn't practice at all .  there were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie .  animation was also pretty damn bad .   the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars .  as i stated before ,  i do not believe in god ,  and i don't think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god .  my personal view ,  jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah's  ( look up apollonius of tiana )  and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death .  according to the wikipedia article on the historicity of jesus  ( and there's a good citation for this so it's garbage )   " virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from galilee who was regarded as a healer ,  was baptized by john the baptist ,  was accused of sedition against the roman empire ,  and on the orders of roman governor pontius pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion . [1] "  i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director's insecurities than anything else .  i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else .  the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal .  he's not even coy about it .  the way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially ,  that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing ,  the way that flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch .  flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going ,  if he was more tactile with his interview .  instead he comes off aggressive with  " isn't it bad to teach kids this stuff .  "  the guy cuts the interview short and i mean ,  what did he expect ,  the principal to say  " oh yes ,  i see it is ,  i have seen the light ,  this will now be a secular school ?  "  it seems that flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood .  this isn't about the documentary ,  this is about flemming's insecurities ,  and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary .  flemming shows what he's really doing here ,  and that is the real downfall of this so-called documentary . 
0	think of this film as a saturday morning live-action program from ages ago .  even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses !  i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting ,  especially in the costume department !  too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over ,  but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings .  and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place ?  i thought this was a  " family "  movie !  mst3k ,  here's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season ! 
1	along with patrick mcgoohan and robert culp ,  jack cassidy was an iconic columbo villain .  the very first  " proper "  episode of columbo ,  following two standalone pilots ,   " murder by the book "  is not far off classic status .   jack cassidy plays ken franklin ,  one half of a murder mystery writing partnership .  his partner jim is the talented one ,  whereas ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill for promoting the books .  as soon as jim has decided he no longer requires ken's marketing skills ,  ken hatches a plot to kill jim .  except it's not a new plot ,  it's actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books .   it doesn't take columbo long to work out that ken is the murderer ,  although unfortunately another murder has to take place  ( ken romances and then kills a key witness )  before columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction .   nothing whatsoever wrong with  " murder by the book "  ,  but it's not quite top-notch .  i would just give  " publish or perish "  the edge over this :  both episodes feature jack cassidy and the world of publishing ,  but  " publish or perish "  is a fraction more tense and unpredictable .  but this is still a great episode . 
1	i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine .  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 ,  it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x .  of course ,  at that time x meant maturity .  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release ,  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then .  however ,  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film ,  which included prostitution  ( the title itself was slang for a male prostitute )  ;  homosexuality ;  loneliness ;  physical  ( and to some extent emotional as well )  abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day ,  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release .  it is worth noting that in the 1970's ,  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r ,  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg-13 by today's standards .   i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie .  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women .  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women .  after being rejected by all the women he has come across ,  he meets a sleazy con-man named enrico  " ratso "  rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman .  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager .  once again ,  joe is conned and before long is homeless .  however ,  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment .  without giving away much more of the plot ,  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams .  i . e .  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health .   i want to make some comments about the movie itself .  first of all ,  the acting is excellent ,  especially the leads .  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end ,  there are some classic scenes .  in fact ,  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny ,  i find them amusing .  for example ,  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over .  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says  " hey ,  i'm walkin' here !  i'm walkin' here !  "  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry .  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso  ( dustin hoffman )  sends joe  ( jon voight )  to a guy named o'daniel .  what is amusing is that at first ,  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut .  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned ,  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self-defense  " john wayne !  you gonna tell me he's a fag !  "  what i like is the delivery in that scene .   i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late '60's ,  much of it rings true today .  that's because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years ,  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago .  also ,  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character .  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie ,  he had matured a great deal and that ratso  ( dustin hoffman's character )  was a good influence on him .   in conclusion ,  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie ,  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on .  for example ,  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings .  also ,  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck  ( jon voight's character )  and the people who were in his life in texas .  even the ending ,  while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie ,  is rather open-ended . 
1	recap :  zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with thierry .  thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way .  he has submerged himself in work ,  laid of his writing ,  and zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them .  into this enters johnny ,  and old friend of thierry's who once were artists in exile together .  but johnny has kept on painting ,  and just have a day job for the rent .  he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny .  there is an instant raw attraction between zandalee and johnny ,  and they enter into an affair .  but zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband .  but none of them ,  not zandalee ,  not johnny and not thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control .   comments :  it is set as a thriller .  but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death ,  and threat of violence .  not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions ,  but the threat comes from a different angle .  and it is not really until the second half in zandalee until the thriller emerges ,  and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half ,  i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then .  much more of a romantic drama than anything else ,  but with the underlying currents of other genres .  the developing thriller is there ,  but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind .  because that is what it is all about ,  what drives the characters and therefore the entire story .  desire .  the need to have ,  and the need to be .   in my opinion it is quite good ,  definitely a lot better than its current  ( 4 . 1 )  rating anyway .  it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense ,  and it handles the erotic part very well ,  with taste .  it is always an integral part of the story ,  needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight ,  and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that .  but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end ,  and the end itself feels kind of flat ,  even if in its own way kind of dramatic .   the cast is impressive ,  spearheaded by known actors like nicholas cage and judge reinhold .  but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson .  beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire ,  she excels were both cage and reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough .  her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in zandalee ,  i can only hope it is because of her own choices .  also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie ,  it is steve buscemi and joe pantoliano .   when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie ,  it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves .   7/10
1	   " bleak house "  is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen .  alway one of my favorite novels , i was exteremely pleased with this television mini series .  the late ,  great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock .  the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book , oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story .  over all a brilliant , moving and atmosphereic film . 
1	this would have been so much fun to see in a theater ,  back in 1996 .  there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies .    " the dentist "  is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters .  maybe the ada launched a campaign against it ,  since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for  " the marathon man "   ( which only has one scene comparable to the many in  " the dentist "  )  .   it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page ,  the movie was shot in 21 days .  of course ,  post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for  " the dentist "  is picture perfect .  the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist  " takes care "  of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening .  the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations !  corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically  " off "  characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist .   for me the pacing of the movie was just right .  the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way .  all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office .  there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival .  meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown !  unlike so many movies of this genre ,  the script is very very tight .  all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways .  two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end .   definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests . 
1	i saw this film when it was originally released in 1989 .  i enjoyed it then ,  and i still do now .  but what i realize now is that this is quite  " adult "  for a film with a g rating ,  especially the notion of dying and going to heaven .  burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together ,  and reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog .  there are some good songs ranging from upbeat  (  " let's make music together "  )  to downright emotional  (  " home to my heart "  )  .  i found the plot good ,  although it does go off on a tangent once or twice .  the final scene of the film with charlie and anne-marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation .  a film worth experiencing . 
0	greetings again from the darkness .  what ever happened to the great barry levinson ?  he directed two of my all-time favorites in  " avalon "  and  " diner "  .  he had some fine movies as well  (  " rainman "  )  ,  but always provided something of interest  .  .  .  until now .  i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring .   " envy "  is the definition of boring .  never of big fan of pure slap stick  (  " dumb and dumber "  )  ,  i was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is .  there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long .  the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound-alike .  if the film had been written as well as the song ,  it would have been tolerable .  rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy  ( even julianne moore )  ,  but the real world exposes one weaknesses .  snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess .  the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller .  the first work commute together flashes some promise ,  but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script .  this script is like most of jack black's character's ideas - not a bad thought ,  but no hope for success . 
0	wow .  .  .  what would you do with $33m ?  let me give you a choice ;  you can either a )  shred it and flush it down the toilet or b ) make a film based on the premise of whoopi goldberg as a hard nut futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like  " i didn't butt trumpet "  and blows raspberries on the basis that this is funny .  that's right ,  you would choose the option that has more merit - flushing down the toilet .   this has to be seen to be believed .  i cannot even find the words to describe how bad this film is .  it doesn't even fit into the  " so bad - it's good "  category .  i actually have it on the television as i write - and whilst watching i felt the need to come onto imdb and register my disgust .   considering jurassic park was made a couple of years before ,  how on earth did they think that audiences would any longer tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit ?  wg should have simply walked and damn the consequences .  everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money .   i have to stop writing - i am about to implode . 
1	this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance . obviously , the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment . it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along . i won't go int to the storyline here . but i will get into the acting , which is terrific . everyone is well cast . the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters . the same filmmakers that made batman :  dead end and grayson also made this short film . of the three , i probably liked this one the least , but i still thought it was well done . for me , world's finest is a 7/10
0	what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle  ( hackman )  and russo  ( scheider )  .  in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer  ( who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr .  moreau )  the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier  ( rey )  .  the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny .  correct me if i'm wrong ,  but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack !  !  !  a street value of 32 million but yeah ,  let's send doyle to find this guy ,  it was his pinch after all .  please !  !  !  the story was weak .  the acting was terrible  ( with the lone exception of hackman ,  who completely overplayed his part )  .  the direction was all over the place .  even the cuts between scenes were terrible .  do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one . 
1	  have you ever felt like your being watched ,  like someone keeps tabs on every move you make ?  well ,  just remember before you decide to break the law ,  the fbi will always be there .  at least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama ,  the fbi story .  it traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities in the world  ( in 1959 )  ,  by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents ,  chip hardesty  ( james stewart )  .   chip was with the fbi from day one ,  and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world ,  even occasionally his family .  the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent ,  and how being one affects his personal life .  the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them .  the audience gets to see chip stop ku klux klan riots ,  go undercover to solve an indian murder/estate scandal ,  bring fugitives into custody ,  rescue hostages ,  and helped fight in wwii .  he even helped bring communist spies to justice .   stewart ,  in a vaguely complex performance ,  is stellar  ( as always )  as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much .  one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside workings of both chip's family life and his job .  we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son .  we also observe his wife having a miscarriage ,  and his marriage having rocky times .  almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job .  vera miles gives a spotty performance ,  but it's very convincing ,  none the less .  she was never a brilliant actress ,  but there was always something very attractive and alluring about her .  well maybe that's just me ?  sadly ,  none of the other performances are worth mentioning ,  but the attention-grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested .   the cinematography of this film was impressive ,  especially the scenes in the south american jungles .  the colors all had a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film .  perhaps the greatest part of this movie was mervyn leroy's fabulous direction .  every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story .  it's chock full of ingenious camera shots ,  some with a very hitchcockian feel .   all in all ,  the fbi story is a spectacular ,  but overlooked film .  clocking in at two and a half hours some viewers might be intimidated ,  but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one .  i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance ,  and the captivating story . 
1	i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were ,  nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original .  this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me ,  and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it .  i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie ,  but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick ,  nor did it over embellish that fact .  the characters all had human traits .  the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful ,  and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives .  i give this movie two thumbs so far up .  definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years . 
1	four great stories from master robert bloch ,  adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies ,  are the base of this excellent amicus' production .  this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid-seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies .  this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet ,  where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child ,  heiress to her mother tradition .  great fun from start to finish ,  and good to very good are also the other three episodes  ( with the last one a bit on the comic side ,  but with the great addition of ingrid pitt ,  the most famous vampress of the english cinema . 
0	dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichés .  man and woman fall in love and marry ,  husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune ,  woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no . 1 reappears .  the movie is reminiscent of yash chopra's chandni and countless others .  divya bharti and shah rukh khan give good performances .  amrish puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain the music by nadeem shravan is superb ,  all the songs were brilliant .  my favourites are sochenge tumhe pyar or koyi na koyi chahiyye .  dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions . 
1	this ,  despite not being the original - it began life as a play in central europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed  ( mgm's own remake with period songs in the good old summertime ,  the broadway show she loves me ,  even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of years ago )  and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat .  several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try ,  for example ,  removing ugarte ,  ferrari ,  renault etc from casablanca and yes you'd still have rick and ilsa and viktor lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below .  jimmy stewart and maggie sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of frank morgan ,  felix bressart ,  joseph schildkraut and andy hardy's sara haden and this is before we factor in that lubitsch 'touch' .  okay ,  maybe they were a tad more naive ,  innocent even ,  in that jurassic age but how many genuine film lovers ,  sated with scatology ,  screwing and in-your-face sex ,  turn back to those days of stories ,  style ,  slickness and skill and wallow in great movies like this one .  by far the best thing about this technological age is not csi but dvd that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it . 
1	i have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed :   " a scanner darkly "  and  " immortel ad vitam "  .  if you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed  ( like me )  ,  you will probably enjoy renaissance .  it immerses you into the world of a future paris .  it is not quite dystopian .  they did the animation so well that i thought it was rotoscoped ,  but from what i can tell ,  it was not ,  it was merely motion capture .  the facial expressions are amazing !  not since tron have i seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation/live hybrid .  the black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene ;  my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams ,  watch for it .  the director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find .  the overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises .   the plot is secondary ,  but it isn't terrible .  it is noir-ish .  there is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth .  there is weather .  there are  " sets "  so you can feel like you are in different places in paris .  there is some action ,  and even a car chase .  i am going to have to see this one again to get everything .  i also recommend a very large screen to view it as the  " sets "  are detailed and the credits are small . 
1	first of all for this movie i just have one word :  'wow' .  this is probably ,  one of the best movies that touched me ,  from it's story to it's performances ,  so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni .  i was very impressed with this last one ,  because he really brought depth to the character ,  as it was a very hard role .  still ,  the two of them formed a pair ,  that surprised me ,  from the beginning until the end ,  showing in the way ,  a friendship filled with love ,  that develops during the entire day ,  settled in the movie .  the story takes some time to roll ,  as the introduction of the characters is long ,  but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity .  if you have the chance ,  see it ,  because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for many time .  simply amazing - 9/10 . 
0	i am a shakespeare fan ,  and i can appreciate what ken branagh has done to bring shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers .  however ,  this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences .  add that with alicia silverstone's stumbling over the dialogue  ( reminiscent of keanu reeves in much ado about nothing )  and other poorly cast roles ,  it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing . 
1	the tweedy professor-types thought they had it all figured out .  today's peoples who inhabit polynesia descended from migratory asians ,  intrepidly moving from the far east ,  island to island ,  eastward into tahiti and all the other exotic tropic isles of the south pacific over thousands of years .  but the established thinking just didn't sit well with young norwegian ethnographer thor heyerdahl .  if that explanation were true ,  how come some folks born and bred in those islands have traditions ,  artwork ,  and physical features resembling not those from asia ,  but south america ?  how can the vegetation of ecuador ,  peru and chile look so much like what you'd find on the island several thousand miles away ?  is it just a coincidence that the islanders point out to sea in the direction of south america and say that is where their ancestors came from ,  led by tiki ,  their equivalent of adam ?  meanwhile ,  how is it norwegians speak of scandanavian forerunners who were chased from the south american continent they had colonized ,  and ,  together with some of the native peoples they befriended ,  set off over the sea -- heading west ?  it's all too much to be a coincidence to heyerdahl .  with an amazing amount of moxie ,  a handful of crewmen ,  and the local know-how for traditional raft-building ,  an expedition begins .  it's as much a trip into the human imagination as it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible with only the very basics of tools and seamanship .  the oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach ,  but it soars with a spirit of adventure besting even the space program that launched a decade later ,  as men are willing to risk it all to test a theory they think is true .  wonderful .  do yourself a favor and read the book first .  it is an amazing page-turner and the perfect setup for the newsreel-style movie . 
0	this movie has one redeeming feature .  at one point ,  after a character is attacked by an ax-wielding fairy ,  his brother asks him ,   " why is your dick over there ,  chuck ?  "  after suffering through almost an hour of bad film ,  this almost made my drink come out my nose .   some of the acting isn't too bad ,  but the kids all stink and p .  j .  soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film .  the story is weak and nobody does what you think  ( or what common sense dictates )  they should .   of course ,  there are a lot of story points that don't add up .  for example ,  in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist ,  a difficult feat since they apparently can't interact with physical matter .  however ,  minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them .  apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes they can't .  go figure .   lots of blood and guts ,  though .  .  . a few nice boobs .  but this doesn't make up for the deficiencies .   if you want a movie about the tooth fairy ,  go rent  " darkness falls "  .  i think it's great ,  though a lot of other reviewers don't share my opinion .  at least it sets a mood . 
1	 " bread "  very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and  " night of the living dead "  in specific and is constantly inventive .  the production values are a little rough at times  ( it's a student film ,  after all )  ,  but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain .  hey -- george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered  " dead "  video tape ,  laserdisc and dvd .  .  .  that should tell you something . 
0	in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations ,  managed many pro wrestlers  ( including 2 backyard wrestling stars )  ,  worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling dvd's .  i have never witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity ,  lack of talent and skill ,  and shoddy production quality found in splatter rampage wrestling .  to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term .  shot with low-dollar video cameras ,  it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards .  the sound quality is bad ,  the video quality is bad ,  and the acting is horrendous .  the  " wrestlers "  wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves .  sometimes the  " matches "  are on the grass .  sometimes on a back yard trampoline .  all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill .  in short ,  don't bother with this stinker .  whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic  ( both in my case )  ,  you will be terribly disappointed . 
0	i don't'know .  .  .  maybe it's because i'm brazilian but all that stuff was too much .  too much love for the music ,  too much parties ,  too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters  ( come on ,  it's not so sad )  and the aspect of the city shown by the director .  everything looks too fake to me :  the families ,  the relationships ,  the music ,  the  " happiness "  .  it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture .  i must be honest :  it did seduce me a little ,  but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music ,  sex and parties ?  i'm not that stupid :  what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea ,  profound sadness and stds ?  i liked the scene with caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people . 
0	make up your own mind .  personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder .  no offense mr .  wonder .  maybe it is comedy ,  but i just found it stupid .  not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids ;  wheeler ( seann william scott ) and danny ( paul rudd )  , two energy drink salesmen ,  to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny ( jane lynch )  .  one of the misfits is ronnie ( bobb'e j .  thompson )  ,  a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie ( christopher mintz-plasse )  ,  a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world .  wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life ,  love and heavy metal .  lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies .  supporting are :  elizabeth banks ,  ken jeongg ,  kerri kenney-silver ,  amanda righetti and david wain . 
1	weak scripts at times ?  yep !  cheesy special effects at times ?  yep !  deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time ?  yep !  more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin ?  yep !  i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid ,  but found so much of the dracula/frankenstein/mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap .  it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters ,  and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the  " dark side "  of entertainment .  the duke had rooster cogburn ,  eastwood had dirty harry ,  garner had maverick and rockford ,  selleck had magnum ,  and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak .  mixed in with all those weak scripts ,  cheesy special effects ,  that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars ,  there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak .  he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger ,  was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth ,  and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials .  additionally ,  unlike 98% of us ,  kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done ,  even if it meant his demise ,  the end of his journalistic career ,  or jail time .  for all his faults ,  including no taste in clothes ,  carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang  ( which was an old used car at the time )  on his way to save the day for humanity .  as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin .  now that he's passed on and his show is on dvd ,  i hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again ! 
0	i am very sorry to say this but  " thunderbirds "  does not even come up with a loud pop ,  never mind any thunder .  at one stage i gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema ,  i stayed in the forlorn hope that the film might improve .  i was to be disappointed ,  it did not get any better ,  it got worse if that is at all possible .  had i gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a  " spoof "  i would still have been let down .  they had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here ,  they have totally wasted that opportunity .  bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and jonathan frakes well what can i say ,  he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth .  i saw this film at a pre-release showing ,  i had been waiting to see it most eagerly ,  having grown up in the sixties with the original shows .  to say i was disappointed would be something of an understatement .  one final thing i will say about the film was the puppets in the tv shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film . 
0	it's hard to believe that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame ,  with x-files ,  one of the best sci-fi series ever ,  being at the top of the glory .  nine years later he is almost forgotten ,  and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably .  i cannot even explain why ,  he is a fair actor ,  but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from .   at the same time angelina jolie was much less known ,  and she was really lucky that a film like 'playing god' did not led her career into a dead-end .  fortunately for her ,  'the bone collector' and 'girl ,  interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner ,  and when lara croft came ,  her career was launched .   there is not too much to be told about this film .  it's the only big screen film of andy wilson ,  and there must be a reason .  all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob .  the off-screen voice is especially bad ,  with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film .  you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental stores ,  or on tv .  try to look for something better . 
1	this is my second time through for a perfect spy .  i watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it .  i like it still .  it's natural that it gets compared to the beeb's other big le carre' series ,  tinker tailor soldier spy .  tinker tailor focuses on the  " game "  spies play ;  perfect spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person a spy is .  there are a number of themes that these movies share ,  along with others in the genre .   ambiguity - moral ,  sexual ,  interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true vs .  false ,  inside vs .  outside ,  love vs .  responsibility .  in a way ,  these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect -  " backstabbed "  in its various nuances .   the theme of fathers and father-figures is also important .  one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick ,  the main character magnus' perhaps ersatz father .  throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed .  a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he's been toppled ,  who seems impervious to what others think of him ,  asks magnus each time they meet ,   " do you love your old man ?  "  and never ,   " do you love me ?  "  maybe it says this somewhere else ,  but a perfect spy is a love story .   another theme is that of malignancy .  the nature of the business is to turn others - turn them against their government ,  against their friends and associates ,  turn them against their values and beliefs .  in each of the le carre' movies i have seen ,  the spy who came in from the cold ,  looking glass war ,  tinker tailor soldier spy ,  smiley's people ,  and a perfect spy ,  turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy .    finally ,  not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot ,  or perhaps two shots bookending the story .  violence ,  torture ,  cruelty are always just beneath the surface .  we see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects le carre''s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass .   if you haven't seen the films above ,  and you enjoy a perfect spy ,  you are in for a treat .  i'd also recommend the sandbagger series  ( yorkshire tv )  ,  the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity .  the ipcress file and burial in berlin are nice ,  though light weight .  for political intrigue try a very british coup ,  house of cards and yes ,  minister/yes ,  prime minister .    if only a brit would set his hand to making the three kingdoms - there would be a film with intrigue and complexity . 
1	this movie ,  even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving ,  strong film .  bette davis ,  as the slutty ,  vicious cockney waitress mildred is absolutely believable .  watching her performance is still spellbinding .  she makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time .  leslie howard's performance as the weak ,  obsessed phillip carey is not as strong ,  but i don't see how any actor could hold their own against ms .  davis's performance .  she chews up the scenery in every scene she is in ,  totally stealing the show .  this is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the academy award ,  but lost .  it was shocking for it's day what with themes of unwed pregnancy ,  multiple sex partners ,  and mildred's vicious language so it is somewhat dated ,  but still an excellent movie .  just to see the scene where mildred tells phillip what she really thinks of him  (  " you cad ,  you dirty swine .  .  .  .  "  )  is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film . 
1	finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen .  well ,  we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers ,  andy  ( played by hoffman )  and hank  ( played by hawke )  will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down ,  but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie .  hoffman is superb ,  as usual ,  and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself .  hawke might have been a little out of his element ,  but he played the part well enough .  add into this mix andy's wife ,  played perfectly by marisa tomei ,  cheating with hank ;  andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions ;  and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery .  this movie will get you thinking . 
0	saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was .  don't get me wrong ,  george c .  scott was terrific as scrooge ,  but the rest of the cast fails so very badly .  sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line :   " merry christmas to everyone !  "  other times i almost fell asleep .   the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy ,  who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug .  after 30 minutes ,  the rich guy is visited by three ghosts ,  who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all .   i can not understand how this movie ,  with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes ,  can be so well-rated .  instead of this piece of garbage ,  i recommend to you ,  the bill murray comedy scrooged .  that at least ,  was funny .  .  . 
0	this is a terrible movie ,  terrible script ,  bad direction and nonsensical ending .  also ,  bad performances ,  except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here ,  and michael pollard .  watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line .   the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related .  the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role .  you can see the plot points a mile away .  the actions of the female lead and that of her brother ,  the cop ,  also make no sense .  so ,  a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise . 
0	this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr .  it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie  " misery  ( 1990 )  "  .  i cannot understand how this movie got a 5 . 2 score ,  because it has no story what so ever ,  and when the movie finally ended ,  i was relieved .   this movie should have been released as a short-movie instead .  .  to much time is spent on the same thing .  and as in every bad movie ,  everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span .  .  .   so ,  before you decide to watch this movie ,  be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control ,  because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding .  .  .  don't worry ,  you wont miss anything important . 
1	maybe i'm biased to foxes ,  fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done .   i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable ,  such as the fire and the room  ( trying not to spoil too much here )  .  i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand .   after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused ,  one says that at the end -spoiler- the mother and her son appear ,  as she's been the one telling her son about her story .  the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end ,  merely a painting of a girl with a fox .  can someone enlighten me on that ?  anyway i really enjoyed this movie ,  although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through .  still worth it if they can sit still . 
0	please do not let the cover of this movie fool you .  and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at :  this isn't it .  usually i will go for stupid if it's funny ,  but this stupid was so stupid it almost  ( or possibly did )  make me stupid .   the film quality is better than a handheld ,  but not by much ,  and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the samba 2 key on a casio keyboard .  these problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing  ( weep )  cast ,  and you have a real humdinger .   the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend .  he also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office .  on the way there they meet a female in distress ,  who is then invited to come along by the other girls .   the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house .   from there you  ( the audience )  and the morons ,  um ,  actors ,  try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another .  overall i think i have made it sound better than it is .  the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped ,  the plot contrived ,  the acting bad and the motivations clueless .  once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas ,  it is not .   the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway .  please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie .   ( woah ,  my nose just grew eight inches .  ) 
1	this is a really fun movie .  one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted ;  more and more funny .  sally field ,  teri hatcher  ( in her hey-day )  ,  kevin klein ,  elisabeth shue ,  robert downey ,  jr .  .  . it's all these well-known ,  quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars/producers .  if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought ,   " how on earth did they come up with this idea ?  ?  "  ,  you will love this movie .  i have seen it multiple times ;  and each time i watch it ,  the more i appreciate the humor ,  the more i realize just how well-acted it really is .  don't expect oscar quality .  this is a fun movie to entertain ,  not some artsy attempt at finding  " man's inner man "  ,  etc .  sit back ,  relax ,  and laugh . 
0	from everything i'd read about the movie ,  i was excited to support a film with a christian theme .  everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done .  especially the writing !  without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance .  the writer/director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story .  believe me ,  it was no big surprise .  i kept waiting for the teenage/young adult back-story to unfold ,  but it never did .  as someone who has gone through a divorce ,  i was very disappointed .  this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian ! 
0	this film is shoddily-made ,  unoriginal garbage .  i like romantic comedies sometimes .  watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner .  it's not something you are going to do all the time ,  but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being .  this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time .  everything about it screamed made on the cheap .  it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out .  it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets ,  too .   the writing was clunky .  i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy ,  but you usually don't really care because you are laughing .  this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved .  events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition .  sure ,  this is how all movies work ,  but you shouldn't notice that it's happening .  inelegant .  that's the term i should use .   there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable .  i didn't care who ended up with whom ,  as long as they all stayed the hell away from me ,  and i didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore .  why would the only really cool character in the movie ,  the paul rudd character ,  want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy ,  condescending ,  control freak played by eva longoria ?  also ,  almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation .  a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out  ( and bathe with )  with a woman he is attracted to ?  the best feel-good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudd's equally annoying lying ,  kleptomaniac sister ?  lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive ,  appealing women .  maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road . 
0	for me ,  this movie just seemed to fall on its face .  the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer .  i don't know whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor ,  but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain .  he's a good guy ,  and that's always obvious in his performances .  other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story .  nothing very innovative  . 
1	what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme !  the summary from taxman is great .  i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing ,  i must have been 10/11 at the time i watched it .  i think for a girl that age part of attraction was lead's very blond hair ,  and his permanently sad state .  the theme was played on a flute i recall - although i cannot remember how it went .  i think the intro showed him playing it - or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad ?  maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune ,  but at least i now know it is not just me . 
1	i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton's james bond and although it wasn't his deserved '3rd bond outing' it was a laugh .  belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely ,  but was probably underused .  his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men .  the other brit in it was a bit shocking ,  but overal it was a laugh . 
0	having watched this movie on the scifi channel ,  i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives .  the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences ,  or  " delights "  as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me .  the plot isn't really worth commenting as ,  but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory .  before the movie is over ,  we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out ,  yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters ,  yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them ,  a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin ,  a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm ,  a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe ,  yet then jumps off ,  and a whole collection of further ,  bizarre occurrences .  basically ,  if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies ,  avoid this film like the plague .  or as my friend reading over my shoulder says :   " it's the best movie i have ever seen .  "  to which the friend on my right says :   " only battle techno music could have made it better .  " 
0	i'm a big fan of horror flicks ,  and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine .  that said ,  zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen .  so needless to say i really enjoyed it ,  it's the best bad movie i've seen in a long while .  the story has some similarities with dan o'bannon's  " return of the living dead "  ,  but whereas that film was intentionally funny ,  this one is the opposite .  it has some of the most laughable acting i've ever witnessed ,  especially from the main scientist character .  his scenes with the general were just hysterical .  also ,  the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy ,  and the death scenes are often just downright stupid .  this ,  of course ,  makes it all the more fun .  possible spoiler - the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head ,  which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge  ( obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string )  ,  latching onto the guys neck ,  killing him .  zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now ?  it defies every law of physics known to man ,  and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed .  that's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess .  i can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here .  if you are a fan of bad movies ,  do yourself a favor and rent this sucker . 
0	murders are occurring in a texas desert town .  who is responsible ?  slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions  ( the latter really doesn't fit )  ,  but otherwise strictly for slasher fans ,  who will appreciate the gore and nudity ,  which are two conventional elements for these films .   dana kimmell  ( of friday the 13th part 3 infamy )  stars as the bratty quasi-detective teen .   *1/2 out of ****  mpaa :  rated r for violence and gore ,  nudity ,  and some language . 
1	robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects .  i mean ,  this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about .  robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s .  if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period ,  most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time .  it wasn't until terminator 2 :  judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized ,  and story boarders began to use that motive .  but you'll have fond memories of transformers ,  gundam wing ,  even power rangers ,  if you watch this film .  the enemy robot is very menacing .  it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan .  and there are some great moments within this film .  a traitor/spy is working within their midsts .  who you think is on your side ,  backing you up all the way ,  could be the person you didn't expect him/her to be .  and that's very troublesome to think so ,  don't you agree ? 
0	i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great .  but what i witnessed was to awful for words .  i don't mean to be harsh ,  its just the movie was terrible .  overall it had bad ,  i mean awful special effects ,  the acting wasn't too bad ,  but wasn't good either ,  and sasquatch himself was like .  .  .  .  well ,  not sasquatch .  in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons .  its not violent or horror ,  but it has the best depiction of sasquatch .  at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off .  only see this movie if you are desperate ,  or really appreciate anyone in the film .  or go watch boondock saints ,  it is much better . 
0	i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe ,  and robert rodriguez .  i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover  ( as an actor )  that this movie would be good .  it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it ,  than it has to be good right ?  wrong wrong wrong .  by far the worst editing since  " manos hands of fate "  .  the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore .  i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film ,  maybe they owed somebody ,  but they are way to good for this .  besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn't even talk .  so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing ,  poor acting ,  and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned . 
1	diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home .  he was already the biggest star ,  and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football .  everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius ,  but the manager thought that he was not yet ready .   history records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly - they hadn't really needed maradona .  the same was not true in 1982 .  spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina .  menotti - still chain smoking - played diego this time ,  but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy .  maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around $7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one-nil .  it was not an auspicious debut ,  and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match ,  maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude ,  petulant foul on brazil's batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentina's reign as world champions .   but now that was all behind him .  maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca ,  and left in 1984 to join napoli .  it was as if he was finally home .  the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor ,  underachieving napoli .  gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee ,  and the city was determined to make him feel at home .  so ,  for the time being at least ,  maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites ,  and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menotti .   maradona is the hero of this story ,  a one-man world cup winning machine .  in 1982 ,  hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles ;  now the british press yearned for a rematch  ( with the same result )  in mexico city .  maradona was still regarded with distinction in england ,  remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain .  but he was still an argie :  the enemy .   england actually started well ,  and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes .  a key event happened on 8 minutes .  fenwick ,  the big and limited english defender ,  was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area .   after a tense first 45 minutes ,  the second half started with a bang .  maradona danced forward after 50 minutes ,  but could find no way through .  similarly valdano's attempt hit only white shirts .  then the moment of infamy that serves as diego's epitaph .  hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area ,  shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was maradona ,  somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net .  how had he done it ?  simple :  handball .   the most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion .  every spectator waited for mr al-sharif of syria to blow for the foul  ( he didn't )  .  shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle .  unless he assassinates the pope ,  or becomes the first man to step foot on mars ,  when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long ,  lingering ,  slow motion ,  followed by the look of glee on his face .  the next image will be his next gift to the world - the world cup's finest goal .   burruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half .  he span ,  and accelerated away from beardsley and reid .  this was the real diego - he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick .  fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack .  normally ,  he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradona's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card ,  but who cares ?  then fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated ,  and decided to run at maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off ?  diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over .  butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement .  shilton charged out in panic ,  and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score .  now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot ,  which smashed into the goal .  england were coming home .   during this magical mexican summer ,  the world had found a successor for pele .  in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970 ,  but had had great players all around him .  maradona did not .  1986 was his world cup . 
1	every once in a while ,  eddie murphy will surprise you .   in a movie like  " the golden child "  ,  especially .  this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone .  but eddie really does work ;  he's smart ,  he's funny ,  he's brave ,  kind ,  courteous ,  thrifty ,  clean and everything else a hero should be .   having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil  ( embodied perfectly by dance )  ,  eddie goes from california ,  to nepal and back ,  all while the beautiful kee nang  ( lewis )  wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man  ( wong ,  perfect as always )  knows that he is .   it's exciting ,  breathtaking in spots ,  shocking and ,  of course ,  funny .  eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about ed mcmahon .   no problem with this  " child "  :  it's a  " golden "  find .   nine stars .  viva nepal ! 
0	this movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should .  among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes .  the movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy .  the acting is worse than keanu reeves ,  the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college ,  and the dialogue is the worse i have seen in a movie .  the plot also was worse by ten fold .  i'd stick to the amateur route .  the audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too .  unless your a diehard jenna jameson fan there is little here .  4/10
1	this is what i call a great movie .  it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story .  there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic .  but the main theme is very cruel ,  like live is . the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country  ( jugoslavia )  on their way to the capital belgrad .  the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way ,  connect the people and the pigs that travel together .    watch it and you gonna remember it for life .  .  .  its filled with slavic humor and lifestyle .   and another reason for its magic  :  it is hard to get !  ! 
1	this is one of three 80's movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately ,  still overlooked .  one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva ,  a movie horribly overlook due to salva's legal/sexual problems .  another would be cameron's closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated--not great ,  but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen .  paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think .  i mean ,  10 years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause ,  whereas something that i might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether . 
0	christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon .  this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump ,  or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man ,  or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam .   too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life ,  the supporting performances by charlton heston ,  carroll o'connor ,  shirley jones ,  mike connors and shelley winters were excelent .  3 of 10 . 
0	far from providing the caffeine kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy-boosting of warm beverages ,  coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale .  indeed ,  if the movie was a cup of coffee ,  it'd be rather weak and watery ,  littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste .  sporadically it hits the spot ,  but otherwise it isn't the hot action-drama it hopes to be .   plot-wise ,  coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug-pushing ,  lady-pimpin' ,  mob-suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved ,  sick state .  socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy ,  and it makes for some thought-provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro-american minorities .  sadly ,  the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus .  coffy's ideas are important ,  it's just that they are not well-aimed .   one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier .  grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence  ( how do you deal with a house full of hoods ?  drive the car right through the front door !  )  .  it's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions ,  wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible .  the low budget can't have helped ,  but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick ,  coffy lacks groove .  just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality ,  consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection .   the total result is workmanlike and wooden .  we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie .  it's a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze ;  it just never ascends above being an average ,  lukewarm number . 
1	stage adaptations often have a major fault .  they often come out looking like a film camera was simply placed on the stage  ( such as  " night mother "  )  .  sidney lumet's direction keeps the film alive ,  which is especially difficult since the picture offered him no real challenge .  still ,  it's nice to look at for what it is .  the chemistry between michael caine and christopher reeve is quite brilliant .  the dynamics of their relationship are surprising .  caine is fantastic as always ,  and reeve gets one of his few chances to really act .   i confess that i've never seen ira levin's play ,  but i hear that jay presson allen's adaptation is faithful .  the script is incredibly convoluted ,  and keeps you guessing .   " deathtrap "  is an enormously entertaining film ,  and is recommended for nearly all fans of stage and screen .   7 . 4 out of 10
1	the cinematic interests in the british monarchy continues with the young victoria  ( 1837 to 1901 )  ,  after having seen in recent years ,  the efforts with keira knightley's the duchess ,  cate blanchett's elizabeth films ,  and scarlett johansson and natalie portman's take on the boleyn sisters with the other boleyn girl .  more contemporary stories would include helen mirren's award winning portrayal of the queen on the current reign of queen elizabeth ii at the turn of princess diana's death .   each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas  ( ok ,  so some may dispute johansson )  or were the flavour of their moment ,  and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured ,  and in fact elizabeth had enough to span two films .  however ,  the young victoria ,  as the title already suggests ,  is a lite-version of the young queen's life ,  and if you're looking for that definitive event ,  or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady ,  self-serving politicians ,  unfortunately there's nothing of depth here .   that's not to say the young victoria is without .  directed by canadian jean-marc vallee  ( best known for crazy )  and written by julian fellowes ,  this film chronicles in very plain terms ,   , the life and times of victoria  ( emily blunt ,  soon becoming the new it girl )  when she was a child ,  the troubles she faced before coronation such as the eagerness of her mom the duchess of kent  ( miranda richardson )  and her adviser sir john conroy  ( mark strong )  to appoint themselves as joint-regent to her throne ,  as already planned for by reigning king william  ( jim broadbent )  .  as if that wasn't enough ,  the political power play enters the picture with lord melbourne  ( paul bettany )  being a prime minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new queen ,  and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace .  on one hand you'd understand the need for a young ,  and new queen to have trusted people in key positions ,  but on the other ,  are they really acting in her interests ,  or in the interests of others ?   even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with prince albert  ( rupert friend )  ,  where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film ,  and pretty much everything already included in the trailers .  for both ,  they've been brought up under the influence of others ,  and told each step of the way exactly what to do .  even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance ,  if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding ,  and to do so with the help of each other .  instead of being pawns ,  there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling ,  and at times absurd ,  rules and regulations .  trust also becomes a much valued commodity ,  and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean .   however ,  all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative ,  from childhood to romance ,  marriage and children .  in fact ,  there's so much fast-forwarding here ,  especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles ,  that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more ,  and room of course for another movie ,  which i suspect would probably not see the light of day ,  but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response ,  and come out with a mini-series or such .  it's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes ,  sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues ,  that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary .   with its star-studded cast ,  one would expect more ,  but one would be left wanting more instead .  recommended for those who are ever curious about kings and queens in the british monarchy ,  only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned . 
0	isn't anyone else tired of that old cliché' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film ,  gives us some informations ,  and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason ?  i know i am .   the sad thing is that it's use in this film is worthless .  if you have seen the first film  ( the first remake i should say )  then the information given is completely worthless ,  because you would have already known it .  i guess ,  you can that it isn't worthless to the main characters .  . but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head ?  wouldn't he want to live ?  sure ,  he would have died anyway .  .   this is the second film to be titled  " the hills have eyes ii .  "  the first being the sequel to the original 70's film .  this is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me .  see ,  i'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a hhe2 to begin with ,  much less an original hhe1 .  and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original hhe1 .  .  . it just makes it worse !  but anyways .  .   wes craven's original hills have eyes was decent .  in the end ,  though ,  the idea was better than the presentation ,  but he most likely had a low budget .  to be quite honest ,  wes craven isn't that good of a horror director .  he's only made a few good horror movies  ( nightmare on elm st .  ,  new nightmare )  ,  a few alright ones  ( scream )  and a bunch of horrible ones  ( cursed ,  shocker ,  vampire in brooklyn )  .  oh yeah ,  and he made swamp thing ,  as well .  .  . but the original hhe2 falls under the latter category .  i've only seen a few minutes ,  but it was terrible .   now he has co-written the new hhe2 .  . and it's such a disappointment !  last year's hhe remake was even better than the original film .  it was tense .  i guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family ,  and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers .  it made us feel dirty .  for the first hour ,  we were in hell ,  and finally in the last few moments ,  the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good .  .   this new film has no tension .  no suspense whatsoever .  just violent things happening to mostly stupid people .  there is hardly any menacing presence here .  just ugly hobos hiding under rocks .   i'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making .  it was just the other day that i watching  " deep blue sea "  where samuel l .  jackson kept on walking around the water ,  while giving the speech ,  and then he gets eaten by a shark ,  only because the idiot stayed to close to the water .  . something that nobody would do in the given situation !  here is the exact same thing .  people go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying .  . seriously ,  couldn't a potty break wait ?  and then when you think people would have learned ,  someone else goes of by themselves !  seriously ,  isn't more scary when the characters are bringing their a-game and still losing ?  i would think so .  .  .   it even under delivers .  it should have made the first remake look like  " the fog "  remake  ( which was less menacing than an episode of  " becker "  )  .  more bad guys .  more time in the caves .  more tension .  more of everything .   but it actually downgrades .  less bad guys .  no tension .  sure we have more time in the caves ,  but not a whole lot happens there .  in the end ,  it only seems like there is two or three bad guys .  the last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people .  where is this tribe ?  who keeps on watching them through binoculars ?  seriously ,  these are the things this film should have brought us ,  but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us ,  with that exact same  " being watched "  scene .  come on !  i'll give the devil it's due .  the look of the film is good .  . but thats it .   i don't even think fans of gore will like this .  . though i'm probably wrong !  there is gore  ( though most of it is sped-up while in the dark )  ,  but without the tension ,  and characters you even care about .  . the gore does nothing in my book !  in the end ,  you're not frightened .  you ; re not shocked  ( unless you're an 8 year old girl )  .  you don't even feel like you have seen anything new . 
0	i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find ,  so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the $10 and bought it ,  now i understand why its so rare !  this film is so bad ,  so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits ,  which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines ,  are literally the movie's highlight .  the film is about a psychic  ( pettyjohn ,  cast for one obvious reason ,  her topless scene )  whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality .  when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it ,  and gee ,  what do you know ?  surprise !  a kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out ,  instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face ,  then escapes to a nearby city .  but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own ,  but no matter ,  this movie blows all its credibility long before then .  this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs ,  somebody needs to alert the producers of  " mystery science theater 3000 "  if they don't know about it already !  2 out 10 ,  really ,  really bad ! 
0	saps at sea   aspect ratio :  1 . 37 : 1  sound format :  mono   ( black and white )   suffering from 'hornophobia' ,  ollie embarks on a 'restful' boat trip ,  but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict  ( rychard cramer )  .  chaos ensues .   this feature length comedy - an ok entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of laurel and hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between l&h and producer hal roach .  episodic in structure ,  the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous cramer  ( who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is !  )  .  the gags are ok ,  but inspiration is lacking ,  perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turned-director gordon douglas ,  previously responsible for ollie's first solo effort in the sound era  ( zenobia ,  produced in 1939 )  ,  but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz .  fair ,  but nothing special .  l&h regulars charlie hall and james finlayson make guest appearances . 
0	the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie .  as usual tom villard is good ,  too .  otherwise it's c**p .  the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out  " the possessor "  ?  lame . 
0	god ,  i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called  " cartoons "  !   since anime became popular ,  the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a 5-year-old-lazy-ass style of drawing  ( kappa mikey )  or some cheep japanese animation rip-off .   ( usually messing up classic characters )  no wonder anime is beating american cartoons !    they are not even trying anymore !    oh ,  i just heard of this last night ;  i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in 2005 , well ,  i never knew the uk was so up-to-date with current shows . 
1	the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary .  this is still a must see for ww ii buffs ,  descendants of the participants of that conflict ,  politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier  ( did you hear that george bush ?  )  and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict .  the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained .  there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented .  actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories .  many of the interviews are with second line authorities ,  that is ,  support personnel to the main characters ,  privates ,  captains ,  secretaries ,  eyewitnesses and the like .  you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about .   i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary .  i strongly recommend this over the worn out ,  gaptoothed ,  overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay .  i paid $120 cdn for five 2-sided dvd discs .  this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode .  the menus are easy to follow ,  there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode .  it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years ,  nay ,  after 60 years since the war finished .   i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy .  now my wish has finally come true .   see this documentary .  tell your friends .  buy a copy for your library .  remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america ,  russia ,  britain ,  canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory .  what an eye opener . 
1	sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite t . v shows of life  : d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school .  so far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times .  melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to .  she's funny ,  smart ,  outgoing ,  witty ,  and a lot more .  caroline rhea and beth broderick both fit the part very well as sabrina's aunts .  zelda ,  the intelligent scientist ,  and hilda the crazy ,  wacky one make a perfect balance in sabrina's life .  though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years ,  but that doesn't mean they weren't still good .  i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped ,  it made sense and i loved it anyways .   :  ) 
1	one woman ,  by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time ,  doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat .  .  .  but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come !  writer / star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress ,  and enlarges them to terrifying proportions ,  so don't watch this film alone ! 
1	no message .  no symbolism .  no dark undercurrents . just a wonderful melange of music ,  nostalgia and good fun put to-gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it .  it's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios .  of course anything with the incomparable judi dench is worth watching .  and cleo laine's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus .  this lady is in the same league as the late ella .  this goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime i feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle .  just a wonderful film ! 
0	well where to start here ?  straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma .  had this film come out of italy in ,  say ,  1975 ,  been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess ,  then i'd be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summer's day .  because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema ,  dan reed has produced a rape/revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england ,  and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowan's leg into a machine gun .  because if you want to play grindhouse bingo ,  then let me call out the 'numbers' :    1 .  rich ,  high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and ,  equally implausibly ,  gets the hots for him .  check .   2 .  gratuitous shots of said high-flying career woman in various states of nudity .  check .   3 .  convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in .  check .   4 .  unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape .  check .   5 .  gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off .  bingo !    plotwise ,  straightheads is pretty basic stuff :  dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss .  on the way home ,  they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson .  the couple then set about getting their revenge .  so far ,  so  " straw dogs "  ,   " late night trains "  ,   " house on the edge of the park "  ,   " i spit on your grave "  etc etc .  so why didn't i think much of this film ?  a number of reasons :  i suppose first off ,  having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better ,  but it's the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most .   because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70's ,  then they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator .  the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies ,  the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back ,  and everyone goes home satisfied ,  their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored .   as writer and director however ,  dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that ,  and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there .  for instance ,  when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers ,  they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with .  when anderson finally meets him face to face ,  he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter !  !  !  the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw-dropping ,  it's almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience's moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they've just sat through something of significance .  to make sure we 'get it' ,  at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ,  ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter ,  but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough-handled and raped across the bonnet of her car .  gratuitous does not enter into it .   after being told his reasons for raping her ,  anderson ties him over a table ,  rams the business end of a sniper rifle  ( complete with bulky silencer ,  just in case anyone wasn't clear on the phallic imagery )  up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger ,  telling dyer  ( who has no such moral qualms )  that 'it's over' .  dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes .  it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness .   in fairness ,  ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film .  it's obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and ,  bless her ,  she certainly does that ;  one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun ?  dyer ,  on the other hand ,  does what he's done in virtually every film he's made to date - that is ,  plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin ,  a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching .  this is particularly true at the closing scene where ,  after murdering his assailants in cold blood ,  dyer gazes at the camera in ,  what i'm sure is meant to be ,  a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome ,  but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess .  which incidentally ,  sums up this film quite nicely . 
1	anna  ( ursula andress )  is brought in as an official r . n .  by ex-lover benito varotto  ( duilio del prete )  ,  ostensibly to nurse an aging widower ,  count leonida bottacin  ( mario piso )  ,  back to health after a heart attack .  but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen ,  including american entrepreneur mr .  kitch  ( jack palance )  ,  with ulterior motives ,  reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count .  he has a history of ,  well ,  liking women ,  and would be actually a bit more  " vulnerable "  as he is cured .  the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count .  the ending might be said to be ironic ,  but it is probably better described as predictable .    but so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy ,  from start to finish ,  and oh how good .  there are many nude scenes ,  including ones of anna and jole ,  one of the malevolent heiresses ,  played by luciana paluzzi .  both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex-bond women ,  and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers .  as she did in thunderball  ( remember fiona volpe )  ,  luciana plays a femme fatale ,  sort of ,  although less elegantly .   perhaps the best scene is anna's  ( slow )  complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone ,  the  " other patient "   ( who incredibly is resisting )  ,  in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot .  but even at this point she is already two-faced  ( for the better )  ,  for she has decided not to go along .  however ,  benito is more than a two-timer with women ,  having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole ,  and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled  ( to put it mildly )  argument between him and jole .  this is a standing-up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only .  another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool .  the count is free ,  as the client ,  to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula ,  and he takes advantage .  hey ,  somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions .  erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase .   " the sensuous nurse "  is compact ,  77 minutes ,  but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption ,  start to finish .  definitely recommended .   
0	despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago ,  i have never come across this italian  " sword and sorcery "  item on late-night italian tv and ,  now that i have seen it for myself ,  i know exactly why .  not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore  ( of which there is some examples to be sure )  or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time  ( it is set in the dark ages after all ) it is ,  quite simply ,  very poor stuff indeed .  in fact ,  i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and ,  believe me ,  i have seen plenty  ( especially in the last few years i . e .  following my excursion to the 2004 venice film festival )  !  reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent  ( and regrettable )  career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore ,  i can see their point :  i may prefer fulci's earlier  " giallo "  period  ( 1968-77 )  to his more popular stuff horror  ( 1979-82 )  myself but ,  even on the latter ,  his commitment was arguably unquestionable .  on the other hand ,  conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist ,  sprinkle it with incongruent characters  ( cannibals vs .  werewolves ,  anyone ?  )  ,  irrelevant gore  ( we are treated to a gratuitous ,  nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists !  )  and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked ,  brain-slurping villainess  ( don't ask )  and her slimy reptilian pet !  !  for what it is worth ,  we have two heroes for the price of one here :  a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey  ( andrea occhipinti )  and his rambling muscle-bound companion  ( jorge rivero i . e .  frenchy from howard hawks' rio lobo [1970] !  )  who ,  despite being called mace  ( short for maciste ,  perhaps ?  )  ,  seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protégé out of trouble  ( particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils' )  .  unfortunately ,  even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-goblin claudio simonetti's electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times .  fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness  ( after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bowso much for his own supposed physical strength !  )  onto his next  and thankfully unfilmed  adventure ! 
0	this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie .  on one hand the imagery ,  camera ,  lighting ,  cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly  " expensive "  look and feel .  even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot .   in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all .   so 50% of the dialog consists of  " what the hell was that  ?  "  ,   " what was that  ?  "  and  " what the hell was that  ?  "  .  in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though .  in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them .   the only reason why skye bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with .  that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to .  i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this :   ben :  is this real ,  huh  ?  emily :  stop it .  ben :  a mass psychosis ,  huh  ?  jon :  somebody has to take control of this situation .  ben :  this situation can't be controlled .  not by you ,  not by anybody .  emily :  not by you either .  ben :  no  got me goosebumps .  but not for horror ,  more for the horrible attempt .  in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita .   2 stars for the excellent technical work . 
0	when i look back on my college days at ohio university ,  there will always be one event in which i will remember with fond memories .  channel 23 is ou's local access channel and until the last few years ,  pretty much played anything they were sent .  this included many diy movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow peeps and then scanning pictures of them online ,  to a version of macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs .   however ,  the king ,  in my opinion ,  of the channel 23 lineup was midnight skater .  the first time i watched it was around 2am .  i should have been studying .  or sleeping .  or watching regular tv .  but no ,  all that is for pussies .  my roommate and i watched midnight skater ,  and when it was complete ,  i don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened .  but sure enough ,  it was on a few nights later ,  and we had to come to grips that this movie did ,  in fact ,  exist .   i could go on and on about how awful it is ,  but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living .  the plot is disjointed ,  the acting terrible ,  the everything soul scarring ,  but by god ,  if there are others watching with you ,  its impossible not to have a good time watching it .  its sort of like the first time you hear  " guts "  by chuck pahalniuk .  you hear it ,  you're disgusted and shaken ,  but five minutes later ,  all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured .   long story short ,  midnight skater ,  for all of its epic flaws ,  makes for some very late night fun .  plus ,  i desperately want the theme to midnight skater .  kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it .  sweet god i love that song . 
0	all internet buzz aside ,  this movie was god awful .  i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything .  instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie ,  and they completely missed .  there were only a few good parts ,  and a couple good lines by samuel jackson .  other than that ,  it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes .  all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie .  now that the movie has actually come out ,  hopefully this joke will die .  don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash .  if you're looking for something that's funny and entertaining ,  then just go to snakes on a blog . 
1	this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season :  the others  ( in order of viewing )  were the uninspired the black tulip  ( 1964 ;  from the same director as this one but not nearly as good )  ,  the surprisingly effective lady oscar  ( 1979 ;  which had originated as a japanese manga !  )  and the splendid cartouche  ( 1962 )  .  actually ,  i had watched this one not too long ago on late-night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it ,  so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around  ( also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion )  .   incidentally ,  fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned cartouche :  not just cast and crew members  ( producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine ,  cinematographer christian matras ,  actor noel roquevert )  but plot-wise as well  in fact ,  the hero is a womanizing soldier  ( jean-paul belmondo's cartouche had also had a brief military spell )  who's loved by a fiery girl  ( in this case ,  gypsy gina lollobrigida )  while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love  ( here ,  it's none other than the king's daughter )  !  as in the later film ,  too ,  fanfan  ( an ideally cast gerard philipe who ,  ironically ,  is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time )  is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men  ( one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father )  and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks  ( the ageing roquevert ,  with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl )  !  ;  for the record ,  lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film ,  rene clair's delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit  ( 1952 )  .   fanfan proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising  ( but well-deserved )  best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris  ( 1951 )  ,  detective story  ( 1951 )  ,  othello ,  umberto d .  and viva zapata !  in fact ,  its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version  ( presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole )  and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant ;  being obviously a foreign-language title ,  there's also the dubious choice of an english-dubbed soundtrack but ,  even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering ,  when all is said and done ,  there's simply no substitute for the original !    fanfan la tulipe  ( a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour )  contains about as much comedy as  ( the expected )  action and romance ;  while some may find this overwhelming ,  i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and ,  on the whole ,  this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski's equally droll the adventures of gerard  ( 1970 )  .  that said ,  the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise  ( particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent )  and the film itself rather adult at times  ( with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout )  when viewed back-to-back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now ;  the climax ,  then is quite ingenious :  the enemy forces  ( who ,  amusingly ,  are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish !  )  are depleted by our heroic trio alone ,  much to the king's amazement who ,  as portrayed by marcel herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne''s children of paradise  ( 1945 )   is himself something of a lecher .   p . s .  an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian-jaque's promising champagne for savages  ( 1964 )  for months now but ,  despite programming it three times already  ( with a tentative fourth one slated for next week )  ,  they have yet to show it ;  even so ,  i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile  ( equally culled from late-night italian tv screenings )  :  the three-hour epic la chartreuse de parme  ( 1948 ;  also starring gerard philippe )  ,  the second twin  ( 1967 )  and the legend of frenchie king  ( 1971 ;  with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale )  . 
0	i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week ,  and i'm still working off the trauma .  essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh ,  sharp ,  deep ,  entertaining and promising .  well acted too .  natural .  my problem ,  however ,  is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning ,  nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp ,  grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken ,  toothless ,  bread-chewing hags .  it's rather with the fact that they never warned me !  !  !  the festival brochure synopsis described only the  ( utterly intriguing-sounding )  first half hour - a whore ,  piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar ,  pretending to be an advertising agent ,  genetic engineer ,  and petty government administration official ,  respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come .  serves me right for not reading the reviews ,  you might say - but to my defense ,  a number of reviews i looked at post-fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film .   the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director  ( a bashful ,  tousle-haired russian youth )  who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium  ( the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically ,  and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening ,  though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come ,  judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour ,  and many exasperated comments on exit )  to say the following :  'well ,  i .  .  .  um ,  thank you very much for coming to see this film ,  and i just wanted to say .  .  .  well ,  it's a very long film .  .  .  it took me four years to make it ,  and .  .  .  it's .  .  i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it .  it is very long .  thank you for coming . ' this is what he said .  alarm bells should have been ringing .  'what's he talking about ? ' i thought in happy confusion .  'this is gonna be fun ! ' of course ,  by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me ,  it was far too late to get out .  all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again .  and in the end i can't say i feel in any way improved by the experience .  yes ,  i absolutely loved the first half hour .  it was intelligent ,  new ,  and had a lot to say .  and yes ,  russia is probably in a bad state .  yes ,  every society has many hidden faces .  yes ,  toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard .  yes yes yes .  i get all of this .  really i do .  but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out ,  and so painful to bear .  if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging ,  try the korean-chinese bin jip  ( 3-iron )  .  it's artsy and surprising ,  but also to-the-point and fun . 
1	i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster .  i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family .   i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions .   the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults ,  has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create .   i found the film to be delightful ! 
1	this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats ,  right along side of citizen kane ,  casablanca ,  and on the waterfront .  someone please convince leno to do a sequel !  leno and morita are a comedy duo ,  the likes of which haven't been seen since abbot and costello .  the evil that emanates from chris sarandon ,  tom noonan ,  and randall  " tex "  cobb will give you the chills .  dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of shakespeare's comedies .  and the climax .  my goodness ,  the climax .  i won't ruin it for you ,  but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison .  if you can track down this hard-to-find gem ,  do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately .  i'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days . 
1	possible spoilers re :  late-appearing cameos   seldom does one see so many fine & memorable character actors  ( almost entirely actresses to be precise )  in one film .  even though a few only appear for cameos ,  each one is a gem .  the british do this mix of comedy and real-life pathos better than anyone imo ,  so it is no surprise that most of the actors are brits .   the music is great ;  no doubt much had to be dubbed  ( does leslie caron *really* play the bass so well ?  maybe - who knew ?  )  but clio lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers .   as an aging musician myself ,  not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course ,  it was a heartening film as well -- a great film for anyone whose wondering if they're past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be .  and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage .   i missed a little of the opening ,  but a provisional 9/10 -- and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing . 
0	  cheap-looking and ugly ,  this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience ,  except for one fairly amusing toilet joke .  christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role ,  although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help .    elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role .  jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation .  there is really no reason to make this movie ,  especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin williams's often brilliant improvisations in mork & mindy .   
0	i do not believe all the praise for this movie .  the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth .  michael caine wishes he were olivier ,  and reeves wishes he were caine .  caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part .  jude law ?  you mean the one that did the remake of  " alfie "  ?    this movie was made during a period of caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts .  he would do anything for money .  he would star in such award winning movies such as this ,  and  " beyond the poseidon adventure "  .  what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death .  he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie .  and so does caine .  this movie can be found in the $5 . 97 bin at walmart .  along with gems like  " the island "  ,  and  " blame it on rio "  . 
0	this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete .  the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim ,  was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete .   this movie makes me want to go to the washroom .  i am not a negative type of guy ,  but man the acting in this flick is .  .  .  .  no comment .  the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick .  i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it . 
0	why did i waste my time with this movie ?  there was not a single funny joke or line throughout .  the slapstick wasn't even mildly funny .  i mean really ,  an out of control vacuum sucking pipe ?  why has the national lampoon's name been attached to this movie ?  even christmas vacation was better than this  ( i actually thought that film was very funny )  .   avoid like the plague ! 
1	of watching this as a child .  although i'll probably find it god-awful now ,  it was kind-of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so .  i also recall working on a saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it ,  so i wasn't really paying much attention .  however ,  the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since .  i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail .  12 years ago ,  one person mentioned that ,  possibly ,  he had seen it ,  but he thought it merely a dream ;  a fanciful piffle like wind .  it's no dream ,  my friend .  no dreaming now .  again ,  i haven't seen it since then ,  but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr .  anything that can stay embedded in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a '10' . 
1	the more i watch nicholas cage ,  the more i appreciate him as an actor .  watching this movie now  ( in 2005 )  ,  i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s .  i don't really think it can be considered a film noir ,  but it is pretty dark at times ,  due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters .   typical performances from each of the three main actors ,  who all did a good job with their roles .  i thought ,  however ,  that hopper and boyle's characters were left undeveloped ,  as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it .  hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy .  the plot is really good ,  and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic ,  there were parts where i had to hand it to the director  ( i . e .  when he first sees the sheriff )  .  all in all ,  this movie is definitely worth watching .  ***1/2
1	this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time !  wonderful animation and adorable characters  ( even the bad guys were cute !  )  made this one a total winner in my book ,  and also in the books of those i saw it with .  i still want to see it again ,  but haven't had time .  better than toy story ,  which was good too ,  but not this good  . 
1	** warning - contains spoilers !  **  first of all ,  i would like to say that i really liked this game .  i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents .  i am glad that i did that .   first off ,  i would like to say that the single player was very good .  the first level is probably one of the best in the game ,  when you are at a party in london ,  and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter .  of course you have to rescue her ,  and it is quite a big level ,  but should probably take you at least five minutes .  the best part ,  and i think also the funniest part ,  is when you are in the jet-pack ,  and people are rappelling down big ben .  just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down .  pure fun !   the rest of the levels are very good ,  but pretty short .  there are four mini-levels you can unlock ,  and that is one of the let downs ,  because only the first two of them are actually fun ,  and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives ,  i mean ,  c'mon !  we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad !   the multi player ,  me and some of my friends agree ,  is very good and challenging ,  even if there are no bots .  halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games !  you can be a load of bad guys ,  and you go against each other ,  and you can also set traps ,  which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character .   gameplay - 8 . 5/10  ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved )  .  graphics - 9/10  ( there is the odd bad graphic ,  but that isn't extremely often )  .  multiplayer - 10/10  ( needs no comment ,  just great ,  you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles )  .  sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10  ( the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1 )  .   i give this game :  8 . 5/10  could have a bit of improvement ,  but it's still good . 
1	indian summer is a good film .  it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional .  how about sam raimi playing the camp buffoon .  i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton-like performance .  solid directing and nice cinematography . 
0	the british claymation series putting  " witty "  conversations taped from  " average "  people in the mouths of  " cute "  fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non-british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn't get on u . s .  television .  someone made the mistake of putting it on u . s .  television .   sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit-com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn't  " translate "  from british english to american english ,  what seemed droll and cultured  ( and just a bit dull )  in england ,  comes across in creature comforts ,  the american version ,  as simply boredom with puppets .  there's no through plot-line ,  no characters and after one and a half episodes watched  ( of the three ultimately aired )  ,  no reason to suffer through more .   the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set-up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule ,  the new adventures of old christine  ( or  " how to be a horrible mother - or person - in one interminable ,  unfunny lesson "  )  ,  kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show ,  and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when  " two and a half men "   ( guilty pleasure )  and  " how i met your mother "   ( actual quality writing )  come on . 
0	oh my .  i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends ,  wanting to watch one of those mild ,  feel-good christmas movies ,  and i walk out disgusted .  the movie failed .  full-stop .  paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly ,  along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine .  they try and turn a christmas movie ,  into some new-style .  sort of bad ,  mixed with good ,  but it all turned out very wrong .  the first ten or so minutes weren't too bad ,  but once we saw santa ,  it was over .  it didn't get any better ,  the rate stayed the same ,  there was no character development ,  and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented .  don't watch it ,  whatever you do . 
1	war ,  inc .   ( 2008 )  **1/2 john cusack ,  marisa tomei ,  hilary duff ,  joan cusack ,  ben kingsley ,  dan aykroyd ,  sergej trifunovic ,  lyubomir neikov ,  ned bellamy ,   ( voice of :  montel williams )   a hit-and-miss-21st century  " strangelove "   john cusack  who co-wrote the script with mark leyner and jeremy pikser  stars as a jaded hit-man named brand hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a middle-eastern oil minister named omar sharif  ( yes ,  not that omar sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh )  commandeered by the ex-vice president of the usa  ( aykroyd ,  cusack's old  " grosse pointe blank "  co-hort ,  doing a mean dick cheney manqué turn here )  ,  enlisting brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical turaqistan  ( read :  iraq/afghanistan )  for the american private corporation tamerlane  ( read :  halliburton )  .    while being briefed brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist natalie hegalhuzen  ( tomei )  and eventually falls in love with her .    meanwhile tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of eastern european teen sensation yonica babyyeah  ( a surprisingly decent duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek )  and the idiot son of the country's leader .   what follows is a bold attempt for a 21st century black comedy a la  " dr .  strangelove "  but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message  ( an unjust war being outsourced by american capitalism ,  check !  )    while cusack riffs on his martin blank from the aforementioned  " pointe "  he does add some nice touches of his man in black  ( he does shots of tabasco sauce to take the edge off )  ,  the rest of the cast plays catch up  ( except sister joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for hauser and has one of the film's funniest laugh-out lines :   " my mass communications skills are finally paying off "  )  for the most part .    cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree different  " grace is gone "  and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve  ;  while admirable overall the film's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here  ( and it is noticeable )  except for maybe the well-choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah's idiotic fiancé's entourage .   a nice attempt yet a misguided failure  ;  maybe next time cusack won't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself . 
0	wow ,  this was a very bad movie .  .  .  as read in other comments this movie has no plot ,  no character development ,  they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result .   the editing of this movie was really non-existent ,  it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening .   all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all ,  has bad acting ,  bad dialogue ,  bad everything .   the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor ,  i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this .   unless you are  ( like me )  dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find ,  do not watch this .  period . 
1	the secret fury ,  in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama  ( directed by mel ferrer )  boasts top-notch principals in colbert and ryan ;  it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end ,  when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre .  but for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance -- the immortal ethel mertz on  " i love lucy .  "  oddly ,  vance had very few film roles ;  her true home was broadway ,  where  ( among other gigs )  she understudied for ethel merman .  here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme ;  watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel's linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty . 
1	 " lion king 1 1/2 "  is the funniest non-theatrical release from disney .  i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years .  i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie .   is it better than  " simba's pride "  ?  in many ways ,  yes .  though  " simba's pride "  wasn't exactly bad ,  it did suffer some problems :  lack of an good script and bad characterizations ,  which made impact of what otherwise a okay film .   anyway :  it's nice to see timon and pumbaa's personalities blossom again in the way that we  ( or certainly me )  loved about them in this film ;  in  " simba's pride "  they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the  " timon and pumbaa "  series neither .   this film could easily have been a stupid one ,  but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious .  there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own .  the score is quite good .  there are two new songs ,  which are catchy and two new characters ,  timon's mom ,   ( voiced by recognizable marge simpsons' julie kavner )  and uncle max ,  which are enjoyable .  the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed .  the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place ,  which it could have easily done  ( especially in comedies )  .   but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me ?  yes ,  there is .  although they fortunately doesn't impact too much ,  but i'll mention them :  1 .  many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one .  personally ,  it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones .   2 .  during the climax ,  some of the jokes becomes lame .   3 .  storywise ,  this is timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba's ,  it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times .   but hey ,  those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie .  it is the only really acceptable disney sequel ,  which should be in every movie collection . 
1	get ready for it :  this is one of my favourite films of all time .  i am relatively unaware of david mamet's  ( writer and director )  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times ( it's always a joy to watch )  ,  i can say without hesitation that he is a genius .  this film is extremely well written ,  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit ,  con-artistry and back room hustles .  the feel of the film is very similar to the sting  ( 1973 )  and it also pays homage to film noir .   it's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters .  it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch .   generally ,  the acting is superb- especially joe mantegna- but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine  ( lindsay crouse )  who is not only a gambler ,  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80's hairdo .  i agree ,  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role .   the less you know about the plot of this film ,  the better ,  just like mamet's most recent film ,  the spanish prisoner ,  because the ending will be even more impressive .  just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance . 
1	i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols ,  and that is the reason i came watching this film .   the uniqueness of this film ,  compared to other modern rockumentaries ,  is that it's not just about one page of a band's history  ( like  " i am trying to break your heart "  ,  about wilco )  ,  but rather covers long period of the band's history .  in this movie ,  director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre  ( bjm )  and the dandy warhols  ( dw )  for more than 8 years  ( 1995 - 2003 )  and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video ,  cut than to 1 : 45 hours  ( the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film )  .  the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage ,  which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands ,  through all these years .   both bands in the start of their careers promised to  " make a revolution "  in the music making ,  and not to sell their souls to the devil of  " record industry "  .  however ,  their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular  ( especially in europe )  after only one album ,  while the brian jonestown massacre  ( with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe )  dissolved into oblivion  ( at least how it is portrayed in the film )  .  and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre ,  contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols .   first ,  i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe  ( for example ,  courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates )  ,  but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film .   first ,  it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person .  the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups ,  in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners  ( that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands )  .  it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project .  in the end he was ignored completely ,  as if he was kicked out of the project .  everybody talk about bjm ,  but he does not take part in the discussion .  i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process .  there are always both sides of the story ,  and here we have only one .  .  .  of course ,  as one would expect ,  anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends .   second ,  the film is very dandy warhols-biased .  sure ,  the winner takes it all ,  but the fact that courtney taylor  ( leader of dw )  narrates  ( even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement )  and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally  ( bjm is covered till 1997 ,  and dw - till 2003 )  ,  does not add objectivity to the film .   third ,  the movie is  ( somewhat )  shallow .  what does it want to teach us ?  as one critic said :   "  .  .  .  movie examines old questions :  where does genius fit into a commodified world ?  can it thrive and get its due ,  or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity ?  "  no ,  it does not examine these questions !  it just depicts a story of a brilliant ,  but unsuccessful musician ,  narrated by a less brilliant ,  but successful one ,  who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain .   anyway ,  the movie was fun - it's raw ,  it's fresh ,  it's stylish ,  it's  .  .  .  just god damn interesting ,  at least for the dw or bjm fans .  for the rest of the crowd - i don't know .  .  . 
0	it was a decent movie ,  i actually kind of enjoyed it .  but the ending is so abrupt !  !  there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends .  what happens after the concert ?  what happens with her boyfriend ?  does she hook up with grant ?  does she come beck in the next semester ?  and what about angela ?  obviously holly's performance would knock angela down a few pegs ,  but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts .  there is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying .  i don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something ,  but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke .  i was very disappointed . 
0	with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train ,  this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness !  the acting was atrocious ,  but the story is what i really found appalling .  the acting was wooden and stilted ,  even by early talkies standards  ( the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner ,  neither of whom can do wrong )  .  rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie  ( as she likewise was in 1932's dr jekyll and mr hyde ,  an otherwise excellent flick )  .  and the rest of the cast was worse ,  there being no words to describe their awfulness .    worse than the acting ,  however ,  was the story .  for some unknown reason ,  julie loves liliom ,  a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  he marries julie but doesn't support her ,  instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal  ( lee tracy )  .  and ,  oh yeah ,  he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her .  julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him ,  which only seems to make him more abusive .  what's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story .  somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom .  wtf ?    the last 1/3 of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself  ( a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police )  .  as he lay dying ,  he tells julie  " i beat you all the time ,  but i'm not sorry for it .  "  when he at last dies ,  she finally tells him she loves him .   ( neither character ever said  " i love you "  to the other while they were alive .  )  after his death ,  god's chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can  " do something good "  for his unborn daughter .  the price for this is 10 years in hell .  after 10 years ,  liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter .  he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him  " do something good "  for her ;  he tries to get her to play cards ,  he tries to give her gabriel's horn ,  but she's not interested and rebuffs him .  so he slaps her .  he .  slaps .  her .  and then he disappears back to the afterlife .  looking on ,  we see his daughter tell julie about this .  the girl says the slap didn't hurt ,  that it felt like a kiss .  this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment .  the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible ,  and julie replies that  " someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all .  "  then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train .  blech !    there was one saving grace to this film ,  and that is the interview between the chief magistrate  ( hb warner was truly magnificent here )  and liliom on the celestial train .  the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death .  this scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars .  regarding liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems ,  the magistrate says  " people suppose that when they die ,  their difficulties are ended for them .  you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities .  it is not as simple as that .  on earth your name is still spoken ;  your face is still remembered .  as long as one is left who remembers you ,  so long is the matter unended .  until you have been completely forgotten ,  you will not be finished with the earth ,  even though you are dead .  "  some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i've ever seen .    by the way ,  this story has apparently been filmed many times both as  " liliom "  and as the musical  " carousel .  " 
0	heavily re-edited and often confusing ,  the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better .  this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer ,  with scott glenn's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year-old charge ,  the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family .  an interesting cast - joe pesci ,  brooke adams ,  danny aiello ,  jonathan pryce - have all done better ,  the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott's exceptionally fine score  ( part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard )  makes a positive impression .  one case where the remake  ( made by tony scott ,  the original choice of director for this version )  is an improvement . 
1	pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities .  the acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept .  those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the  " worms "  are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience .   tom cavanagh and hallie kate eisenberg stole the spotlight ,  but the young ty panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few years .   miss eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery .    the story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying ,  friendship ,  and fairness .  it creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some  " gross "  scene from the film . 
0	in a way ,  corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal  :  being seen by thousands .  but it fails at making them laugh .  .  .   les visiteurs has had its success ,  because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel  :  forget about zemeckis's back to the future ,  here comes the old france ,  the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life .  full of pride ,  funny thanks to the ancient words he uses ,  montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor .  then comes the sequel .   nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs ,  the first .  and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money .   the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs ,  and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought .  explanation  :  it's no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen  ;  don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode  ?  where do you think he found the money  ?  selling the jewelry .  .  .  and that's only one of many holes poiré tries to avoid .  .  .  and fails .   let's have a look at the characters  :  montmirail doesn't change ,  he's just a little more boring .  regarding frenegonde .  .  .  that's another story  :  valérie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role .  and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her .  and poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy .   forget about the time travels ,  about the digital effects ,  concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times .   the main interest of this film is the landscapes .  a movie for youngsters ,  let's say up to 13 years old . 
1	twelve monkeys is an insane time-travelling ,  action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole ,  a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996 .  unfortunately ,  he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane .   this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis ,  brad pitt and madeleine stowe .  twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy .  terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece  10/10
1	1928 is in many ways a  " lost year "  in motion pictures .  just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre ,  sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology .    " show people "  is one of the great silent era comedies .  the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him ,  learns his lesson ,  and then redeems himself by winning the football game ,  the polo game ,  etc .  this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane .  she had excellent comic instincts and timing .  this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper  ( marion davies )  and her father ,  general marmaduke oldfish pepper ,  fresh from the old south .  general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress .  while at the studio commissary ,  the peppers run into billy boone  ( william haines )  ,  a slapstick comedian .  he gets peggy an acting job .  she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick ,  but she perseveres .  eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles .  soon the new-found fame goes to her head ,  and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man ,  whom she doesn't really love ,  unless fate somehow intervenes .   one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930 .  this film is one of those ,  as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph ,  an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself ,  and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot .  peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her .  truly a delight from start to finish ,  this is a silent that is definitely worth your while .  this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible . 
1	man ,  i loved this movie !  this really takes me back to when i was a kid .  these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good ,  they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward .  i still remember one of the opening lines .  .  .  .  " tutazema was his name ,  and he was an orphan .  he lived with his sister so and so in the village .  "  this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon .  at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself .  he gets to live the way he always wanted to .  he gets to soar the heavens . 
0	i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier's films .  i consider 'breaking the waves' nothing less than a masterpiece .  i loved 'dancer in the night' .  i admired the idea in 'dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical ,  less cinema .  'europa' which i see only now was a famous film at its time ,  succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie ,  but did not survive well the time in my opinion .  it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste .   the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer .  treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished ,  of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today ,  more such was novel and courageous two decades ago .  yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task .   the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock ,  especially his early films set in the pre-war europe ,  with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark .  the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism .  here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re-birth of germany after war ,  of its might ,  of its obsession with order and regulation ,  of punctuality and civility .  the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys .  the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post-war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption ,  with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers ,  with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self-destruction ,  with love doubtfully mixed with treason .   it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case .  the actions of the characters ,  especially of leopold kessler played by jean-marc barr seem confused ,  and lack credibility .  the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock-like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s .  the usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative .  it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means ,  but he is too demonstrative ,  he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is .  he really is great ,  as he will show in some of his later films ,  but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone . 
1	pushing daisies was a wonderful show .  much like dead like me and wonderfalls ,  you can tell was created by bryan fuller .  i can understand how people who don't have much of a love for theater ,  cinema ,  musicals and the like would be annoyed .  this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some .  these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy .  this program explodes with color ,  winks at old movie scenes ,  hums with incredible music and talented performances .  there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif .  the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love ,  honesty ,  courage ,  loss and so many other things we face every day .  the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled .  don't approach this as a typical tv show .  think of it as an evening at the theater ,  then sit back and enjoy ! 
0	 " american nightmare "  is officially tied ,  in my opinion ,  with  " it's pat !  "  for the worst movie of all time .   seven friends  ( oddly resembling the k-mart version of the cast of  " friends "  )  gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare ,  a pirate radio show .  it's hosted by a guy with a beard .  that's the most exciting aspect of his show .   chandler ,  monica ,  joey ,  and .  .  .  oh wait ,  i mean ,  wayne ,  jessie ,  and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj .  unbeknownst to them ,  a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening .  .  .   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and .  .  .  wait ,  sorry again .  .  .  by making their fears come to life .  these fears include such stunners as  " voodoo "  and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures .   no .  really .   this movie was ,  in a word ,  rotten .  crazy nurse's killing spree lacks motivation ,  there's nothing to make the viewer  " jump ,  "  the ending blows ,  and--again--voodoo ?   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones ,  rent  " american nightmare "  with them .   if you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local blockbuster ,  rent all of the copies of  " american nightmare "  and hide them in your freezer . 
0	twenty years ago ,  the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later .  on the present days ,  michael  ( gordon currie )  invites his girlfriend peg  ( stacy grant )  and his best friends chris  ( myc agnew )  ,  jennifer  ( emmanuelle vaugier )  ,  lisa ann  ( kelly benson )  ,  ned  ( brendon beiser )  ,  mitch maldive  ( phillip rhys )  and trish  ( rachel hayward )  to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm .  he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear ,  and together with his indian friend crow  ( byron chief moon )  ,  they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty  ( jon fedele )  that would eliminate their fears forever .  the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father ,  but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father ,  killing his friends .    " the fear :  resurrection "  is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows ,  but in a messy screenplay full of clichés .  there are some exaggerated performances ,  like for example ms .  betsy palmer ;  others very weak ,  but in general the acting is good .  unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live ;  further ,  in spite of being surrounded by close friends ,  the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies .  the low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation .  in the very end ,  michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story .  i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time .  the special effects are very reasonable for a b-movie .  my vote is four .   title  ( brazil )  :   " fear 2 :  uma noite de halloween "   (  " fear 2 :  one night of halloween "  ) 
0	you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious ,  thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably ?  when you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen ?   " house of the dead "  struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema .   from start to end  " house of the dead "  manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept .  it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size  ( which they exploit shamelessly )  whereas the males for their hardcore  " kick-ass "  attitude .  i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture .  uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie .  at least then we'll get better acting however not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film .  it is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as :   " these are zombies ,  pure and simple "  and  " no cap'n ,  we must not go there !  it's evil !  "  .   we all know that zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning ;  at best they are a harmless two hours of action ,  blood and closet terror .  trash ,  yes ,  but entertaining trash .  not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins .  according to imdb ,   " house of the dead "  received such bad reviews that no danish cinemas bought the movie .  if only we could have had the same privilege .   final score :  1/10 . 
0	these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one .  this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part 6 ,  battlefield earth and gigli had .  those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful .  i haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies .  before i start the review let me tell you the story .  theodore rex is a $35 million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters .  they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades .  whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck .   plot :  a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age .  a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur .   the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery .  then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful .  whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail .  theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen .  most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail ( on accident and on purpose )  .  i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex :  the worst movie of whoopi's career .   don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable .  i didn't see that when i watched this movie .  all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck .  the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney .  utterly painful from start to finish . 
0	i just saw the movie in theater .  the movie has very few good points to talk about .  kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be .  thats it .  the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas .  anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed ,  even mumbai indians too  ( just now chennai has made it to semi-final )  .    but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes .  now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood .  but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real .  but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time .  they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie .  now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people .  but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work .  all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded .  at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar .  this is height of stupidity .  audience is not paying to watch such stupidity .  i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies .  they cant make it .  the last good action i have seen was from  " ghatak "  and  " khiladiyon ka khialdi "  .  the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me .  does these people see their movie after completion ?  can't they figure out that the slow motion action  ( which is done using ropes )  is too unrealistic and childish ?  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it .  i just want to go back to amitabh's era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes .  the sound effect was not very effective in those days ,  but visually it is much better than current era scenes .    this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors .  please don't make any more action movies ,  until you acquire the art of making it realistic . 
0	i'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck .  it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films .  with jedi ,  menace ,  clowns and sith we have the death of lucas' career .  he wants us to swallow the annakin is vader nonsense ?  i never believed it was true .  this film vindicates those feelings .  the story hasn't worked since phantom moron ,  and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade .  i have to go .  i know where some new rocks to throw are .  you want spoilers ?  here they come .  luke and leia are not related .  vader is not their father .  duke countoo should have switched sides while he still could .  yoda has less verbal skills than yogi berra .  his advice has never been any good to anybody .  obi wan lied to luke for the first two films .  annakin didn't build c3p0 .  he found him in the desert and lied to his mom about putting him together from scratch .  chewbacca has fleas .  this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h amma-lamma-ding-dong .  if she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of annie ,  but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her .  what a dope ! 
0	this movie was made for fans of dani  ( and cradle of filth )  .  i am not one of them .  i think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon  ( still ,  i'm generally not a fan of black metal )  .  but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it ,  i convinced myself ,  that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing .  thus i assumed i'm in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background .  now ,  that is what i do like .   i got home and popped it in .  my patience lasted 15 minutes .  awful camera work and disgusting quality .  and that was then  ( 2002 )  ,  that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder .  i left it on the shelf .  maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this .  .  .  picture .    after a couple of months i got back to it  ( in mentioned surroundings )  and saw half .  then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me .  my disliking evolved .  i noticed how funny dani  ( 1 , 65m ;  5'5 "  height )  looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart .   ( yes ,  ripping .  his head apparently had no skull .  )  i also found that this movie may have no sense .  still ,  i haven't finished it yet ,  so i wasn't positive .   after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back .  .  .   ( yes ,  it took me 5 , 5 years .  )  so - dani in fact was funny as satan/manson/super-evil-man's helper and the movie did not make sense .  see our bad person employs dani to do bad things .  he delivers .  why ?  well i guess he's just very ,  very bad .  as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it .   we have a couple of short stories joined by dani's character .  my favourite was about a guy ,  who steals someone's leg ,  because he wants to use it as his own .  yeah ,  exactly .    the acting's rock bottom .  the cgi is the worst ever .  i mean stinger beats it  ( and ,  boy ,  is stinger's cgi baaaaad )  .  the story has no sense .  and the quality is .  .  .  let's just say it is not satisfying .  the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore .  blood and guts are made pretty well .  why ,  you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on .   ( example - dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it .  .  .  and then eats what fell out .  why ?  we never know .  we do know ,  however ,  that this cat must have been on illegal substances ,  as his heart is almost half his size .  )   you might think ,  after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good ,  but it's just bad .  cradle of filth fans can add 3 points .  i added one for gore . 
1	and look how a true story ,   "  .  .  .  with a little help of it's friends .  .  .  "   :  a welldone and touching script ,  a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of  " no-name "  actors ,  especially from the 4-yr-old jodelle ferland ,  becomes a must seen movie .  9/10
1	i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film ,  you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine ,  a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding .  dan in real life delivered that promise .   the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss .  with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche ,  their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys .  the cast ,  sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead . 
1	this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival .  but unlike  " yes "  ,  by sally potter ,  which i had seen some days before ,  where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive ,  this time quite the opposite thing happened :  there was something that dragged me down ,  and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe .  it was as if ,  all of a sudden ,  there was nothing left ,  all hope ,  all future had been taken away to a dead place .   nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked ,  but then ,  one lovely day ,  there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams .  there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion ,  just out of nothing ,  someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life .  that person was toni ,  a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots ,  just like herself .   but the film's title is  " ghosts "  ,  and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish ,  there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people ,  strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself ,  hiding away from all other people .  françoise ,  a french woman ,  is a victim of such ghosts .  she once lost her child daughter in berlin ,  who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket ,  in just one moment of inattentiveness .  now time has passed ,  and françoise is back in berlin ,  still looking for the missing child .   nina could be that child ,  after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity .   and nina adopts that idea ,  after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion ,  she also longs for a mother .  but in the end she is empty-handed ,  toni has disappeared with a man ,  and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman .   " marie is dead ,  "  concludes françoise's husband ,  and the statement could not be more disillusioning .  nina is just a  " niña "  ,  a girl without name ,  there is no hope for any divine fulfillment .  there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives .  therefore ,  in the end ,  we see nina all alone ,  about to walk along the road that has opened up before her ,  into a future that seems joyless and uncertain . 
1	when it comes down to fairy tales ,  cinderella was the one that made you cry the most .  poor cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother .  and thanks to mr .  walt disney ,  we got to witness cinderella in animation .   before the story begins ,  cinderella and her father are lonely ,  and rich beyond their needs .  to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters ,  cinderella's dad marries a woman ,  but then dies soon after .  the stepmother ,  only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter ,  cinderella .   so for many days ,  cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters .  she has hope however ,  thanks to her friends ,  the mice of the home  ( sounds like cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck .  )  she has hope that one day she'll find her prince .  the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend .   9/10
0	for all the subtle charms this student film may contain ,  was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo to show his paper macho face ?  ?   the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop .   don't get me wrong ,  i'm all into exploring america's dark underbelly ,  but this is a turd-a-flambé that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p . clarkson looks hot taking it .   sadly ,  from a guy from wings .   the best 2 minutes the film has to offer .   if you felt like ripping off deliverance ,  you could do better . 
0	the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume :   " can somebody please pass the ketchup ?  "  i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative ;  it works better than an overdose of demarol . 
0	i didn't even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when i saw it ,  but i guessed it through the running time .  it has the same washed-out colors ,  bland characters ,  and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80's ,  plus a 'social platform' that practically screams  " afterschool special "  .  anyhoo .   rona jaffe's  ( thank you )  mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons & dragons ,  a pen-and-paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america .  i count myself one of said geeks ,  tho i have never played d&d specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren .  m&m was also made in the heyday of d&d's major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality ,  be worshiping satan without knowing ,  blah blah .  i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point ,  if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously .   we meet 4 young college students ,  who play the aptly named mazes and monsters ,  to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life .  except that m&m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives .  none of the allure of gaming is presented here-and jay jay's request to take m&m into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere .  it's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don't really care .  jay jay ,  robbie ,  kate and daniel are supposed to be different-but they're all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really has .   but things just continue ,  getting worse in more ways than one .  the low budget comes dreadfully clear ,   ( i love the 'entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns )  robbie/pardu shows why he's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever ,  and the payoff atop the 'two towers' is unintentionally hilarious .  tom hanks' blubbering  " jay jay ,  what am i doing here ?  "  made me laugh for minutes on end .  definitely the low point in his career .   don't look at it as a cogent satire ,  just a laughable piece of 80's tv trash ,  and you'll still have a good time .  that is ,  if you can stay awake .  the majority is mostly boring ,  but it's all worthwhile for pardu's breakdown at the end .  at least tom hanks has gotten better .  not that he could go much worse from here . 
1	shot in the heart is wonderful .  it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary gimore ,  a convicted murder who requested death .  shot in the heart shows the ordeal that gilmore's family ,  torn up by hatred ,  went through .  this movie is an incredible psychological study ,  and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting .  10/10
0	pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series ,  strung together without the usual commercials .  the story is typical of pokemon  ( conflict ,  fighting ,  and a resolution where all are happy in the end )  ,  and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation .  some of the holes in the plot are filled in  ( over the closing credits !  )  without explanation ,  and everything is just a bit too sweet .   why see it on the big screen ?  the only reason is to be a part of your child's world .  both of my sons enjoy pokemon ,  and by my showing an interest in what they like ,  we are closer .  seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube ,  and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience .  i gave the movie a 4 ,  mostly from my children's point of view .   
0	i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go .  this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next .   the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve ,  who has visions of his in-pending danger .  he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club ,  and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is .  to put it plainer ,  reve likes the dutch sausage .  so reve concocts a plan to seduce christine's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him .  but its later discovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands ,  who she all murdered .  now reve and christine's boyfriend could be  " the 4th man .  "  the storyline makes sense with no plot holes .  the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine .  the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts .  basically ,  this isn't my cup of tea .   the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a t-shirt .  so in the very beginning ,  you get to see reve's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state .  later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors ,  and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues .  reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum .  plus there's a lot of blood .  more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined .   not that i have anything against  " shocking "  scenes ,  but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking .  the whole movie is revolved around the shock value .   so if any of this is your cup of tea ,  watch this movie .  otherwise ,  stay far far far far far away from this one .  my mind is still scarred . 
0	normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films ,  but this one really annoyed me .  all they did was swear .  for the whole film .   ( and ,  as someone else noted ,  get cancer )  it was boring ,  rambling and pretentious .  i wouldnt if i were you .    its also not that i dont like films which ,  as most people who like it will claim 'observe life' .  i love eat drink man woman ,  and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives .  but i could relate to them .  i have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film ,  and i used to work on a construction site .  so go figure .  having said that william h .  macy made me grin .  once .    2/10 .  avoid ,  unless you enjoy tedium . 
1	i loves this movie , because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved !  heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe .  it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that .  the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there .  this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers !  i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one .  there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at !  also that that is how people remember them , from their armor .  i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have . 
1	norman ,  is that you ?  was  ( this is all third hand ,  so take it with a grain of salt )  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one ,  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen .  also ,  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video ,  so the prints from the theater can't have been that great .  still ,  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good .    what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece :  it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family .  for that reason alone ,  it's pretty interesting- if not a little  " hollywood "  .  don't believe me ?  check out lines about curtains ,  etc .  very stereotypical .  not too deep .   but .  .  .  the movie really shines in a couple of areas .  there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife ,  who's run away with his brother  (  !  )  to ensenada in a souped up pinto .  the phone conversation across the border is really memorable .    but .  .  .  the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his/their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs .  to the best of my knowledge ,  this is the only time that routine was filmed .  and ,  it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version ,  i'm told .  still ,  it's vintage madame ,  and shouldn't be missed .  people are still stealing lines from wayland ;  the man was truly gifted .  enjoy the movie ! 
1	for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them .  fatty drives the bus is the exception .  it is the truth .  it is the best  " bad "  movie ever .   the  " badness "  of this movie seems to come naturally .  halfway through satan's opening monologue ,  the word  " hell "  appears at the bottom of the screen .  the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress .  it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs .  jesus walks to a funk soundtrack .   anyways ,  fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior's film project .  but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful .  you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad ,  but never forced it .   never to be duplicated in wonder ,  fatty delivers .  highly highly recommended . 
0	myron breckinridge  ( rex reed !  !  !  )  gets a sex change from a doctor  ( john carradine--dead drunk )  and comes out as myra  ( raquel welch )  .  she then decides to destroy male masculinity  ( or something like that )  and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous john huston  ( don't ask )  and break up a young happy couple  ( young ,  handsome ,  hunky roger herren and farrah fawcett--yes the farrah fawcett )  .    they took a great novel by gore vidal that was unfilmable and ,  naturally ,  tried to film it .  they also hired an english guy with a decidedly anti-american attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable  " talent "   ( welch ,  reed )  and embarassed old professionals  ( huston ,  carradine ,  andy devine ,  jim backus ,  mae west )  ,  threw it all together and .  .  .  . surprise !  !  !  an absolute disaster .    the film got an x rating at its release  ( it's been lowered to an r )  ,  mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which welch sodomizes rusty  ( roger herren )  and a scene in which welch attempts to have sex with fawcett .   the movie is very scattershot .  .  . scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense .  it's not good at all but i was never bored .    acting varies wildly .  .  . reed is horrible .  .  . really sad .  huston chews the scenery again and again and again to a nauseating extreme .  welch is actually not bad as myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her .  west is hardly in the movie  ( a blessing )  and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes .  roger herren  ( whatever happened to .  .  .  )  was very young ,  handsome and not bad as rusty .  fawcett is ok .   it's hard to find things to say about this .  .  . you just watch it in disbelief .  a must see movie--to believe !  !  !  ! 
1	 " the muppets take manhattan "  is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far .  for one ,  it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney .  as of 2008 ,  the film still belongs to 20th century fox  ( cbs fox at the time of its release )  even though disney owns the rights to the muppets .  also ,  this film has a story line that's very non-linear ,  and events that are otherwise unpredictable .   of course ,  it's very hard to beat the original  " muppet movie "  from 1979 ,  especially since that movie had more memorable songs than  " manhattan "  does .  however ,  one way in which  " the muppets take manhattan "  is better than  " the muppet movie "  is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios .  in the first movie ,  all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood ,  walk into an agent's office ,  and they are immediately given a  " rich & famous "  contract .  in this movie ,  the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success ,  and it's a lot harder to do that ,  especially in the entertainment business ,  than they initially thought .  that's an important and often times overlooked message ,  provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets ,  being small and made of cloth ,  don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively .  above all ,  their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story .  another note :  the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool ,  and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets .  that ability right there is a testament to henson ,  and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults .   where  " manhattan "  falls flat ,  and this is where i'm sure people will disagree with me ,  is with some of the key songs ,  especially in the end .  i thought the wedding song  " he'll make me happy "  was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding .  it sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral .  every time i watch this movie ,  hearing that song makes me unusually depressed ,  especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as  " together again "  and ends happily for that matter .   " saying goodbye "  was a sad number too ,  but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again .  that last song was such a let down ,  and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen .    " the muppets take manhattan "  is overall a good film ,  and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films ,  including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt .  fortunately ,  the film marches in the same direction as well .  i just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy .  plus ,  disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper dvd release .  maybe it will someday .  we'll see . 
0	wowwwwww ,  about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie !  !  !  i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better .  or at least have some redeeming qualities ,  like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie ,  or like really intelligent ,  or very well filmed or something .  .  . needless to say ,  that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life .  im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this  " may contain spoilers "  .  .  . imdb ,  you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that .  i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings .  .  . all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie .  .  .  im still a big imdb fan ,  but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3 .

0	formula flick of guy who wants girl ,  guy who will lie to get next to girl ,  guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way  ( comedus reliefus ,  no ?  )  to help deceive girl ,  etc .  this one's been done to death ,  and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings ,  it's been done better .   stale plot aside ,  the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments .  jonathon schaech has done better ,  and his acting here came close to being phoned in .  not a complete loss ,  but nothing new here in this tepid affair . 
0	over christmas break ,  a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings .  to make the work a bit more difficult ,  a murderous ,  chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm ,  preying on the group in various violent ways .   registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the u . k .  in the 1980s ,  the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing .  the term 'video nasty' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore ,  violence ,  sex ,  etc .  :  all the things a horror fan dreams of .  so ,  after hearing all of that info ,  i settled into pranks  ( alt .  title )  expecting a sleazy slasher experience .   .   .  and that's what it tried to be ,  but failed pretty much completely .  visually ,  the film's not great .  the cinematography ,  gore  ( except for a couple scenes )  ,  and overall direction all fail .  it's simply not enjoyable to watch .  the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason  ( like the opening kill )  .  there are some cool death scenes ,  including a pretty nice face melt  ( which can be seen on the poster )  ,  but that's about it for the positive .  the acting is pretty bad ,  the story seems unimportant ,  the killer isn't cool or scary ,  and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid :  it's a bit boring .  overall ,  for a film done by a few ucla film students for $90 , 000  ( which would be over double that today )  ,  the dorm that dripped blood isn't a total mess .  it has a couple good things ,  and is fairly watchable .   .   .  but ,  as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces .   .   .  it just cannot compare .  don't expect much ,  and you may at least be entertained .  i hate to say it ,  but this is one of the few films i've seen that would actually be better with a remake .   .   .  and yet ,  they go after great works like black christmas .  oh well .   .   .   obligatory horror elements :   - subgenre :  slasher  - violence/gore :  there are some brutally cool kills ,  and the gore is okay for the most part .   .   .  but nothing special .  also ,  they off-screened some of the best murders .   - sex/nudity :  there's a little unappealing  ( to me )  nudity ,  but not very much .   - cool killer ( s )  :  nah .  the ending monologue ( s )  of the killer made him/her pretty uncool .   - scares/suspense :  a jump scare or two ,  but nothing too effective .   - mystery :  i suppose ,  yeah ,  but i simply didn't care enough ,  and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face .   - - -  final verdict :  3 . 75/10 .  bah !  humbug !    -ap3-
1	ok ,  first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old .  if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time ,  i´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-tv horror film with some well-made scenes .  but when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts .  this scared the hell out of me back then ,  especially those aforementioned zelda- scenes  ( and they still do )  .  nowadays i´m kind of hooked to this film .  i have to see this maybe once in a month ,  and on every new year´s eve i watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends .  it´s like an appetizer for a good party !  i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense .  midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like ,  but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two .  hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which  " the creeds "  underact .  what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary ,  and i don´t mean the zombie stuff here .  the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind .  honestly ,  how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-tv one ,  but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ?  alright i busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago ,  but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection .  but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary !  i really would love to know .  .  . and i don´t mean night of the living dead here .  .  . this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff . 
1	i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians .  with the exception of stewart and novak ,  the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle .  john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village .  i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell ,  book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me .  it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses ,  machine guns ,  or alien monsters and i planned on being bored .  but ,  i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground .  as the glorious george duning love theme soared ,  i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love .  the first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater .  i am sure i'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak's startling ,  direct gaze .  it's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us .  i am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later  .   .   . 
1	kurt russell ,  whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world's fair ,  will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter .  there are times you feel that you're watching elvis until something snaps you back to reality .  .  . perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen ?  all the performances here are excellent :  season hubley as priscilla ,  pat hingle as the colonel ,  even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma presley .   kurt's dad bing is here playing elvis' father vernon ,  and there's a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis' buddy and bodyguard red west .    a must see for rock n roll fans . 
1	white man + progress + industrialization = bad .  first nations + nature + animals = good .  simple formula .  actually ,  in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo ;  now it is used to attack it .  however ,  that being said ,  i think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone .  you may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the west was won ,  er lost .  but anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains .   ( the movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in america before the evil white man brought them there )  .  anyway ,  i liked it .  the quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible . 
1	the life and time of little richard ,  as told by little richard ,  as produced and directed by little richard ,  was about as one sided as one of his songs .  this is not a biography or even a docudrama ,  but does have good writing ,  great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard .  all the music is by little richard ,  so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song .   the movie covers his early childhood ,  carrys thru the formative years in music ,  the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lord .  its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles ,  whom opened for him .   my main objection is that his outrageous ,  counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time .  some of his energy ,  which he still has ,  does not come across full force .  he seemed tame ,  compared to what i remember of him at the time .   the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing ,  to make the point about not having a decent place to change .   if they had gotten into the  " bronze liberace "  as richard use to refer to himself in interviews ,  then there's a story .  trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys ,  giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience ,  his headband .  nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t . v .  appearance you can find .  little richard is always on
1	so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it .  we would watch it all the time .  when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa's magical toys .  i'm 21 now and i still love this movie ,  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it ,  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little .  one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie .  this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe ,  no violence ,  no bad language ,  just lots of great songs and important lessons . 
1	new york has never looked so good !  and neither has anyone in this movie .  while the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it .  you almost wish people like this really existed .  the appeal of the actors are what really put it over ( john ritter ,  colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good .  )  go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did . 
0	i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end ,  after you've already invested an hour into it .  and that's what happened with this film .  i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story .  i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends . fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it .  ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting  ( the wife in particular was so perfect )  . but milo o'shea as a jew ?  !  !  !  !  now that was funny .  i haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film .  before that point ,  a story and characters were developing , there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted .  but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that wasn't the screwiest ,  most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed ,  i don't know what is .  i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that ;  it feels like an act of violence . 
0	what was the point of this movie ?  what was the plot ?  i do not know .  shaq can't act ,  people don't know how to direct ,  and i am kazaam !  a genie who raps ?  come on .  maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this .  i remember i watched this just to kill time .  it didn't really interest me .  i just remember thinking ,   " who put shaq in this movie ?  ?  ?  "  the whole story seemed stupid too .  it made no sense whatsoever .  i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen .  i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about .  i  " wish "  this movie would go away . 
1	el mar is a tough ,  stark ,  utterly brilliant ,  brave work of cinematic art .  director agustí villaronga ,  with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet's novel ,  has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives .  and though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children ,  the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear .  this film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering :  the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood .   a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain ,  threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens .  ramala  ( nilo mur )  ,  tur  ( david lozano )  ,  julia  ( sergi moreno )  ,  and francisca  ( victoria verger )  witness the terror of the assassination of men ,  and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide .  these wide-eyed children become adults ,  carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds .   we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium .  ramala  ( roger casamajor )  has survived as a male prostitute ,  protected by his 'john' morell  ( juli mira )  ,  and has kept his life style private .  tur  ( bruno bergonzini )  has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion .  francisca  ( antònia torrens )  has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium .  the three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war .  tur longs for ramala's love ,  ramala longs to be free from his morell ,  and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit .   the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death ,  between lust and love ,  and between devotion and destruction is played out .  to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer ,  but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved  ( in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film )  and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable .  for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense .  the actors ,  both as children and as adults ,  are splendid :  roger cassamoor ,  bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles .  the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director's vision .  a tough film ,  this ,  but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath .  in spanish with english subtitles .   grady harp
0	tara reid as an intellectual ,  christian slater ( usually great )  as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff as .  .  . well it's stephen dorff for christ sake !  !  !  !  i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort .  you guys are on .  heres an idea ,  just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices , a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this ,  heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton .  i knew you guys would love that .  seriously though you owe me $7 . 50 . 
1	here ,  on imdb . com i read an opinion ,  that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed .  i do not know if he had better nor worse roles ,  i'm not his fan ,  but this one was really exceptional .   the other thing - impressive hand of the movie director .  i give my respect .  the serenity ,  the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively ,  i never met such proximity it in any movie before .   another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie ,  closest to the original books ,  and atmosphere in it .    and little bit more .  i pay my respect to the original grey owl . 
0	this movie is just bad .  bad .  bad .  bad .  now that i've gotten that out of the way ,  i feel better .  this movie is poor from beginning to end .  the story is lame .  the 3-d segment is really bad .  freddy is at his cartoon character worst .  thank god they killed him off .  and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameos ?   the only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy .  we see he once had a family ,  and we get to see his abusive ,  alcoholic father  ( alice cooper )  .   other than that ,  all bad .  there are some quality actors in here  ( lisa zane and yaphet kotto )  ,  and they do their best ,  but the end result is just so bad .  the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back . 
0	i purchased this movie at a car boot sale ,  so i was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as a nightmare on elm street  ( 1984 )  or the hills have eyes  ( 1977 )  but i thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch .  however ,  it proved to be not at all enjoyable ,  but instead the acting and the general movie was mock-able ,  such as the ways the the 'unsees killer' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women .  it was a stereotypical horror film .  i say this because of the following reasons :   1 )  three blonde women in danger ,  the majority get killed .  2 )  one survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer .  3 )  surprise surprise ,  help arrives in the form of a shotgun !   by using three simple points ,  i have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie ,  so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it . 
1	like his earlier film ,   " in a glass cage "  ,  agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor .  this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see .  the heightened drama ,  intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical ,  yet never steps into it .  in that way ,  it pulls off an almost impossible feat :  to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained ,  to be so charged and yet so understated ,  and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye .  unabashed ,  gorgeous ,  and highly tense .  .  .  this film is simply superb ! 
1	being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg ,  as an actor ,  that made me even more anxious to check out this flick .  i remember he was interviewed on  " jay leno ,  "  and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget adam sandler comedy  " the longest yard "  to be in this film .  so obviously ,  snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops .  i'm not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in  " the tenants .  "  there are certainly better rapper/actors ,  like mos def ,  who could've done more with his role .  but the point is snoop did a  " good "  job .  he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections ,  but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing .  the point is i found him convincing in the role ,  and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating .  mcdermott ,  by the way ,  gives the best performance in the film ,  though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's not-so-subtle acting .  being a big reader and aspiring writer myself ,  i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating .  it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work ,  and berate him for criticizing it .  but you know what ?  i'm sure a lot of writers are like that .  his character was supposed to be flawed ,  as was mcdermott's ,  in his own way .  my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending .  for some reason ,  it just felt too rushed for me ,  though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters ,  rather than plot . 
0	when i first heard about  " down to earth ,  "  i was pretty excited .  i'm a pretty big fan a chris rock ,  he was especially hilarious in dogma .  but this film proved to be a disappointment .  chris rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances ,  and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole .   first off ,  chris rock .  he plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine .  obviously ,  this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup ,  but in the rest of the movie ,  it doesn't .  even when he's talking to one other character ,  he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh .  he has a few funny moments ,  but they mostly come during the standup scenes  ( no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian )  .  as for the rest of the cast ,  they're pretty much there just to give rock someone to talk to ,  none of them stand out .   also ,  the movie was poorly directed .  the movie has basically a one-joke plot :  old white guy acting like a young black comedian .  while i prefer movies with more than one joke ,  this still could have worked ,  and been quite funny .  the problem was ,  we saw too much of rock and not enough of the old white guy .  it's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling chris rock's jokes ,  but for most of the time ,  we just see chris rock ,  so it's not nearly as funny .  the few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like rock are ,  in fact ,  hilarious .  if he had been shown more ,  the movie would have been a lot funnier .   overall ,  a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that  " down to earth "  is poorly acted ,  and poorly directed .  this one was a pretty big disappointment .   rating :  4/10
1	the thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of dracula and frankenstein ;  and there's a very good reason for that ,  but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions ,  and the invisible ray is certainly one of them .  the plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before  ( even way back in 1936 )  but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director lambert hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film .  the plot focuses on the good hearted dr janos rukh ;  a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the earth .  his discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it .  however ,  tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element ;  which makes him glow in the dark ,  and also sends him mad .  .  .   the biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - boris karloff and bela lugosi ,  and both give excellent performances .  karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for karloff to impress with .  bela lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in ,  and it's a great performance from him also ;  it's nice to see a bit of versatility from lugosi .  the film does get off to a rather slow start ;  but things soon start to pick up .  the second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and karloff gets a chance to shine  ( literally )  .  the film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting ;  and it does work very well .  the film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely .  overall ,  the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties ;  but it's a very good one and comes recommended . 
1	i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond .  you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group n . w . a .  which dates back to the beginning in 1988 ,  in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 ,  the band breaking up when dr . dre left .  which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and dr . dre in 1991 .  this story was somewhat based on that .   further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree ,  the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious .  not to mention the  " love song "  tasty was hooking up .  and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked ,  just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're managers getting shot every time too .   people who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots ,  my opinion
1	never realized that charles boyer ,   ( luis denard )  appeared with lauren bacall ,  ( rose cullen )  in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together .  even peter lorre ,   ( contreras )  had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint .  this story deals with a republican courier ,  luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations .  lauren bacall ,   ( rose cullen )  comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life .  the real bad guy in this film is victor francen ,   ( licata )   " beast with five fingers "  who gives an outstanding performance .  great classic 1945 film without humphrey bogart . 
1	i loved so much about this movie .  .  . the time taken to develop the characters ,  the attention to detail ,  the superb performances ,  the stunning lighting and cinematography ,  the wonderful soundtrack .  .  .   it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick .  if we lived in elizabethan days ,  i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy .  but since we don't ,  let's say it's more like a drama-suspense movie .   the plot is simple ,  but the story is complex .  the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored .  much of the story is shown rather than told ,  which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book  ( or graphic novel )  .  at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s ,  part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling .   i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon ,  but in this case i do .   ( though i did enjoy the book too .  )  i've bought the dvd ,  which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary .    ( i also took my little cousin ,  who's a little younger than the boy in the movie ,  to see it after i saw it for the first time ,  because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him .  he loved it - and the discussion .  )

0	same old same old about che .  it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che's true character .  sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che .  the silly seductive tale of an argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor ,  until eventually he was murdered by the cia .  yeah ,  yeah ,  heard it all before ,  boring and untrue !  .  the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive !  the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak ,  who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world .  he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war ,  he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york ,  washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world .  che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities .  for the rest of his life ,  he declared that if his finger had been on the button ,  he would have pushed it .  when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world ,  che was furious at the  " betrayal "  .  if che's recommendations had been followed ,  you would not be reading this review now .  how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film .  incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation .  that would make an oscar winning film !  i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking !  they only stick to  " safe counterculture themes "  ,  to wit ,   " che cool "  ,   " wall street bad "  ,   " republican= nazi "  ,   " bush ex hitler "  ,   " nra is worse than kgb "  ,   " christians are fanatics and stupid "  ,  etc .  .  . ad nauseum .  oooh ,  how daring ,  how mind blowing .  tres anti-mainstream and edgy .  i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy !  that would be truly daring ! 
1	this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why .  even 45 years later ,  it is quite an impressive piece of work .  why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain .  good use of live footage and animation in tandem .  this used to run as part of  " vault disney "  every few months or so ,  but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while .  *sigh* most recommended . 
1	written on the wind ,  directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956 ,  is like all of sirk's mid 50's films- pure melodrama .  yet it is engrossing ,  richly developed melodrama ,  and sirk's trademark lurid colour expressionism ,  throbbing ,  barely repressed emotions ,  symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave .   the film opens brilliantly ,  with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling .  sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world .  .  .   robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley  " kids "  ,  kyle and marylee .  he drinks and sleeps around with women .  she drinks and sleeps around with men .  they both are worth millions ,  thanks to the hadley oil business .  hunky ,  yet poor ,  mitch wayne  ( rock hudson )  is kyle's lifelong friend ,  and marylee's dream lover .  enter into this sordid mess lucy moore  ( lauren bacall )  ,  a slim ,  attractive young woman who falls under kyle's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening .  mitch loves her too ,  but kyle wins her .  they quickly marry ,  and kyle stops drinking .  but fate seems to be written on the wind ,  and it is not long before a conniving marylee  ( who will  " have mitch "  ,  marriage or no marriage )  ,  a secretly smitten mitch ,  the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows .  .  .  .   malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley ,  thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar .  she steals every scene she is in .  stack is almost just as good ,  amping up the melodrama ,  while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation .  hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two ,  yet it is in keeping with the characters they play .   so ,  what's all this melodrama really about it ?  well ,  a lot of things .  stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear ,  for one thing .  sirk surrounds stack with phallic symbols throughout the film- note his tiny little gun ,  the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol ,  kyle's seeming inability to conceive children .  stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex ,  made worse by his father's preference for hudson ,  his sister's desire for hudson ,  and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson .  with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town ,  buying cheap corn liquor like a  " bum "  .   it's about impossible dreams ,  and having to let go of them .  the river where kyle ,  marylee and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film ,  symbolising kyle and  ( especially )  marylee's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth .  in an excellent melodramatic scene ,  perfectly pulled off by malone ,  marylee's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child ,  with voice-over of mitch telling marylee that she will always be his girl .  this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer .  who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood ?  who hasn't ,  at some point ,  lived on a treasured memory ?  who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have ?  and hudson's last line of the film  ( yes ,  he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes ,  only close-ups )  recollects on how  " far we've come from the river ,  marylee "  .  amazing . 
1	the number of times i've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few .  and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie .  this movie has some kliches but i really don't care .  i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it .  it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good ,  but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message .  we all know it in our hearts ,  but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it's forms .  it's only when we love that we're truly alive .  i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i'm not usually like that .  i'm quite a cynic .  this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see . 
0	everything about this film was terrible .  to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever .  the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy .  it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating .   please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
0	a singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then-cutting edge rock 'n' roll explosion with the middle-class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom .  the result is a jarringly dated mish-mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music ,  but will at least keep their parents sated .   a quick glance at the promo write-up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content .  tom ewell is a drunken agent ,  overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow  " hi honey ,  i'm home !  "  the blurb sites him as  " so funny in 'the 7 year itch' "  .  it sounds almost like an excuse .  what other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else ?  it reads like  " so funny in 'the 7 year itch'  .  .  .  but he's rubbish in this "  .   mansfield ,  a beautiful girl with rumoured 50-inch assets ,  is ,  unfortunately ,  a bargain basement monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock .  her wooden delivery combined with ewell's ott double-takes make this a comedy partnership from hell .  for her part ,  the sell gives us :   " [jayne mansfield] whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's biggest laughs !  "  as you can see ,  a movie sold on the idea that it's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things .  most of this  " humour "  is men literally falling over themselves ,  their glasses cracking upon site of mansfield ,  etc .  only the freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its  " u "  certificate .   for the musical side ,  the most adenine of players are chosen .  would you really care to see eddie fontaine offer :   " i love your eyes ,  i love your lips ,  they taste even better than potato chips "  in a song called  " cool it ,  baby "  ?  only the incendiary little richard breaks out of the mor ,  though is forced to sing some of his more dad-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence .  and how come all the acts sing without a single microphone ?  attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception .   technically ,  the picture was quite advanced ,  with special effects  ( including a ghost-like julie london )  and deluxe color  ( which now looks flat and artificial .  in fact ,  with its reds that bleed and fake-looking flesh tones ,  it resembles a colorised movie )  .  direction ,  though ,  isn't outstanding ,  and the sound quality is also quite poor .   perhaps it comes down to it being so old .  a time when men still smoked on screen ,  sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance .   ( all of which happen here )  .  yet some like it hot ,  the african queen ,  ben hur and many ,  many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today ,  so the  " good at the time "  argument doesn't really stand up .  at its heart the girl can't help it is a cynical and patronising venture that doesn't bear close inspection .  4/10 .   
0	the good earth is not a great film by any means ,  it is way to ordinary .  maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer .  it is not very interesting to me .  yes ,  luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long .  i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act .  in short wang lung  ( muni )  a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him .  both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds .  the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next .  also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments ,  it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis . 
0	casting bone to pick :  david jannsen was 38 playing the father of robert drivas ,  who was then ,  31  ( yeah ,  i realize he's supposed to be just out of college ,  but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24-25 in the script--- that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high )  .  i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine .  this movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city ,  circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking ,  the weird hair  ( drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip cousin it )  and trendy fashions that went along with it .  if anyone remembers ,  lv wasn't exactly london .  .  .  the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days .  drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous ;  his dad thinks he might be gay  ( in a sad irony ,  drivas himself died of aids at 47 )  and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue  ( ahem ,  as if one may call 7 years a gap )  .  sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino  ( caesar's palace !  )  ,  and plies him with girls  ( including the horny-for-money edy williams )  .  interestingly enough ,  the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay--- unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him .  what nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'r' rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system  ( which then was g-m-r[16]- and x )  .  the editing is horrible and there's stupid-silly overdubs by the committee  ( a late 60's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years )  .  don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer .  .  .  seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later .  not to give anything away ,  but they would've dealt with mr .  rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then .  a curiosity at best ,  far from joshua logan's usual caliber of work .  dos/dias .  now go watch casino again .  .  . 
1	almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad .  it's not pretty bad ,  it's actually pretty good ,  though not great .  the judy garland character could have gotten annoying ,  but she didn't allow it to .  somewhere along the line ,  i've become a fan of brooding ,  overbearing ,  overacting van heflin ,  at least in the early 40's .  judy's singing is great ,  but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship .  i gave it a 7 . 
0	now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy .  sadly and annoyingly ,  here it is ,  flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land .  how did the di-erector get it so wrong ?  well ,  mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously .  unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché  ( but somehow cute )  .  .  . or is that cliché piled upon cliché .  no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van sant's gerry .  .  .  .  .  and with a title like the fluffer how is it all such a lead weight ?  well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own .  convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded streisand lyric ,  we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left .  the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there .  in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot .  originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re-filmed half of it ,  got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto .  . comedy ,  tonight !  a lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up .  i guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform ,  i can understand why . 
0	dude ,  really !  !  !  !  where have you guys been the past 20 years ,  this is shocking in all kind of ways ,  horror  ?  this is a joke ,  there is nothing wrong with being low budget ,  but this is a laugh ,  if you want to look at the classics ,  freaks of tod browning ,  the victims of dracula and frankenstein ,  the undying monster ,  ernest thesiger ,  paul wegener's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train ,  you can't compare it ,  it gives it a bad name ,  bad acting ,  bad screenplay etc .  total waist of money and free time ,  have watched a lot of movies ,  were as horror is my all time favorite ,  i really am speechless ,  have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft ,  please understand
0	ok ok ,  it might be hard to put the entirety of a man's life in one film .  traditionally therefore ,  biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject's life .  now ,  byron was a  " my week beats your year "  fellow ,  which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder .  furthermore ,  just as byron's poetry is inseparable from his life ,  the man's life itself must be seen as a whole .  lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture ,  it's showing a different picture altogether .   now ,  in short my review comes down to this :  supposedly ,  byron was indeed the  " my week beats your year "  prototype ,  a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime .  true ,  he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in - but in the end ,  this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we'd all want to lead ,  no ?  well ,  i did not ,  at any moment ,  want to live the life depicted in this film .  so it gets 3 .  not for being so badly done  ( which ,  direction-wise ,  it more or less was )  ,  but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot .   some more detail .  well ,  to over simplify things ,  a byron bio should have two distinct episodes :  1 .  post-first europe trip :  england and his rise to fame + marriage / 2 .  his life abroad .  now ,  the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first .  not only was it a lot longer ,  but the most significant change in byron took place then .  furthermore ,  it's where he created his best works  ( don juan ,  the vision of judgement etc .  - all the stuff that makes him *really* unique in english literature )  .   instead ,  in this film  ( a )  byron's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining ,   ( b )  it only gets *worse* after he leaves england .  they did two good jobs :  first ,  they started at his return of his europe trip  ( though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue )  ,  second ,  they chose an angle ,  and they chose his incestuous love for augusta  ( who is rather perfectly cast )  .  the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go .  true ,  byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life ,  but ,  especially as he was such a mood swing person ,  the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life .   anyway ,  the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england .  there's no doubt about that .  the thing is :  once abroad ,  a life of debauchery began  ( with the infamous geneva period )  ,  but in italy byron also discovered a new life ,  both for his poetry  ( inspired by italian comedy )  ,  already in venice ,  and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna  ( afterwards ,  at the request of shelly ,  with teresa ,  to pisa )  .  in other words ,  he was also *liberated* .  his mind and life opened up  ( and not only in the decadent sense )  ,  while england's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age .  true ,  freedom was augusta-less ,  but this bitter-sweet freedom tastes sour in this film .  we see a lonely ,  bored snob getting older .   i mean ,  hell ,  byron never thought much about his poetry ,  except when he finally found his own voice in don juan !  apart from poetic and romantic developments ,  his relationship with shelly  ( and the down-break )  should have been more documented .  also ,  it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas .  this is important ,  as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted-in-life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan .  life and work are one .  true ,  still a bit naive ,  but it's what got him to greece !  and the whole thing came full circle in pisa ,  where shelley's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark .  missolonghi wasn't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action .  it was the insights in italy  ( the gambas )  stirring him into action .  it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient-style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism .  but it wasn't just that ,  there was a true inspiration behind it .  meanwhile ,  byron wrote massive amounts of don juan .  true ,  his end is a bit sad ,  but it's not like he's worn out .  that is the essence of byron's life :  he may have had some strong emotional attachments  ( 2 :  augusta and teresa )  ,  but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly .  meaning that he wasn't 'less' at the end of his life - no ,  he'd made a physical and mental journey that ,  at the time ,  few people were prepared to make .   i wonder .  why is it that so often the second period in byron's life is overlooked ?  because it had less obvious conflicts ,  as the man was finally coming to his own ?  in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals ,  we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time ,  which byron so despised ,  and which ,  despite the fact that he had no choice ,  he *willingly* fled in 1816 ,  to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self-obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause . 
1	one thing i can say about this movie is well long ,  very long !  i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out .  i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's  ( even though i never lived in them )  is actually one of my favourite decades ,  especially for the music !  when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive .  i will admitt the animation did impress me !  it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see .  but the movie honestly could of been a bit better ,  it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting .  then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly .  in my opinion i thought it was extremely long .  i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie ,  it made it seem like it was 4 hours long !  !  !  !  but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those  " nothing to do days "  .  i will see the new one and i hope it is better ! 
0	gwoemul  ( the host )  - due to pollution in the han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage .  the youngest member of the park family is snatched by the beast ,  and it is up to the rest of her family to find her ,  before she becomes the beast's latest meal .   firstly ,  i love monster movies :  mutated bears ,  over-sized alligators ,  packs of ravening komodo dragons ,  the whole lot .  creature features are my favourite kind of horror film .  so ,  i really wanted to like the host ,  but it wasn't to be .    there were three major problems with it :   the first can be seen with a quick look at it's imdb page  genre :  action / comedy / drama / fantasy / horror / sci-fi / thriller  too many damned genres .  it took itself too seriously to be a comedy ,  and yet was too light hearted to have any real message  ( though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement .  anti-pollution ,  anti-american or anti-government )  .  the drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles .   secondly ,  after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film .  the central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of korea and america ,  apparently ,  do nothing .  and that's it ,  they just wander about ,  occasionally hitting one another ,  presumably for a bit of comedy relief .  this lack of action made my attention wander ,  and apparently it did the same for the director ,  as whole plot threads go unresolved  ( a mystery plague invented by the evil americans is completely forgotten about ,  and is never resolved )  .   and lastly ,  the film is clumsily political .  it paints the americans as being stupid and evil ,  but gives us no american characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain .  the opening scene has the most obvious stupid american vs wise korean moment .  with a korean morgue assistant asking his boss ,  the coroner ,  not to pour chemicals into the han river .  the american coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on .  as well as being racist ,  it's lazy film-making and there is no excuse for that .   on the plus side ,  the monster is good ,  kind of a mix of the relic and deep rising .  some of the movement effects are quite cool ,  and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun .  there are also some nice shots in the film .  some of which remind me ,  strangely ,  of the way firefly was filmed  ( shuddering cameras ,  out of focus shots etc )  . there is also a nice scene at the end ,  where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family's mobile food stall .  it's night-time and snow is falling ,  the street-lamp is giving out a cold light ,  but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it .   overall ,  i was really disappointed by this film .  i'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick ,  and instead i get some pseudo-political , horror-comedy lite .  looking at the comments on imdb i can't help but think that if this had been a us production it would have been slated .  just 'cause it's a foreign flick doesn't mean it's any good .  there have been some great movies out of korea in recent years  ( the vengeance trilogy and brotherhood ,  for example )  ,  but this certainly isn't one of them .    for once i'm in favour of a remake .  tighten up the directing ,  improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film .  as it is ,  it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time . 
1	this film came out 12 years years ago ,  and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york .  the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses .  anthony slide's 'great pretenders' says nothing .  julian fleisher's  " the drag queens of new york :  an illustrated field guide "  with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge ,  minette ,  the warhol queens ,  and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely .  even laurence senelick's  " the changing room "  - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it .   i understand from the film itself , and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades .  the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in  " the queen "  ,  1968 .  the historical context is the biggest missing part of  " paris is burning "  .   the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored .  it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989 .  the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending ,  but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder .  as we now know ,  dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet ,  but this did not come out until three years later .   of historical importance ,  but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context . 
1	one thing i'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy .  the other films in polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too ,  but they are all different in what makes them creepy ,  but they all roughly deal with the same thing ,  they all deal with the mind .  definitely the staring people are very creepy ,  each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still .  again ,  if you have seen the other two films mentioned ,  i'm sure you'll find this quite creepy ,  because you begin to expect typical polanski traits that you think you have caught onto ,  he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things ,  personally every time trelkovsky would slowly turn around i would be bracing myself for a jump ,  maybe that's just me ,  but it felt intended to do that ,  though it was quite subtle ,  there is no build up of the music in those moments .   the acting in this was pretty good ,  mostly that from polanski of course ,  the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead .  polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker ,  he not only can direct and write great films ,  but he can actually act too .  i don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the trelkovsky character ,  polanski settled right on in perfectly .  i like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast ,  to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent ,  which i respect greatly .   one thing i didn't like about this film is how it was done in english .  for those who don't know ,  this is a french film ,  american financed ,  and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in english .  there are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing ,  and i don't know why it is ,  but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub .  there is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub ,  but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over ,  it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak ,  she had the loudest high pitch voice i've heard in a while ,  it almost seemed fake ,  but i don't see what the point was ,  she was a rather small character .  i honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed ,  parts of it in french and parts of it in english ,  because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near  ( two completely different films ,  i know )  the high standard of another film that did a similar thing ,  which was ,  the good ,  the bad and the ugly .  i realise it's not a big problem ,  just when you do realise it ,  it gets annoying ,  but i'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying ,  regardless if you know french .   whats so great about polanski is that he will let you think you know him ,  that you know his style ,  which in some aspects you do ,  but really ,  you can't see whats behind that corner .  this film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned ,  which i think really strengthens this one in particular .  i personally feel this is the best of the three ,  i'm unsure which comes next ,  but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness .  the ending is fantastic ,  it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere .  i choose not to think to much on it ,  just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that .   i've rambled on ,  and i haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great ,  i don't think ,  so i'll quickly do it here .  if you liked repulsion and/or rosemary's baby ,  i guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least .  for those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then i recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent ,  particularly the end ,  as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind ,  paranoia even ,  though that is better fitted under repulsion . 
1	this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level . however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock , cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere ,  as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend . the story moves with a cracking pace ,  and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie . the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout ,  also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior ,  he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life . indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back ,  the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history . so please take time out to watch this classic western . 
1	i was never a big fan of horror movies .  they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children .  they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore .  the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon .  it was well-acted ,  and had a great story .  but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick's the shining ,  quite possibly the scariest movie ever .   the movie follows a writer  ( jack nicholson )  and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter .  there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family .  but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block .  after months of solitude and silence however ,  jack becomes a grumpy and later violent .  is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad ?   one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes .  the hotel is very silent ,  and the rooms are huge ,  yet always empty .  it is also eerily calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways .  jack nicholson's performance is also one of his very best ,  scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile .  my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator .   the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion ,  beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project .  it may be a oldie ,  but is definitely a goodie .  8/10
0	this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin .   the vhs box said it was rated  " r "  but the into on the actual tape inside said it was  " x .  "  the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking .  even in the dark ,  you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy - and ,  yes ,  you could see his penis in her mouth .  i read somewhere that this was the first time where a  " mainline actress "  had done something like this on screen .   detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body .  she looked beautiful .  unfortunately ,  the movie is ugly .  .  .  . a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers' looks . 
1	this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity .  an artist's profound vision ,  his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna ,  blending his creations with trees ,  white water dashing against rocks ,  fields and rain .  .  . andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive ,  aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth .  he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration ,  but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature .  credit also goes of course to the filmmaker ,  thomas riedelsheimer ,  who directed ,  photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing .   if you have any feeling for beauty ,  nature and art .  .  . do not miss this fantastic film ! 
1	this movie was rather awful vipul shah's last movie was good this one was just bad although it's a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play  " avjo wahala fari malishu "  made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it's still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don't work well but they're still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it's still a story to take in to account and it's good if you're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that's really not needed even one bit
0	overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point .  so she became an actress - so what ?  she learned to love - big deal .  there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations ,  but the kind which is bad for the movie ,  causing it to often seem absurd .   summer phoenix ,  playing the lead ,  talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person ,  so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point .  we are told early on  ( in that  " barry lyndon " -like narration )  that she learned to hide her emotions ,  which certainly explains her autistic stone-face ,  but the movie suffers for it .  she basically walks around like a zombie ,  and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions .  occasionally ,  the movie had that dull ,  sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie .  is it one ?  i wouldn't be at all surprised .   summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix .  nepotism rarely works .   if you'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list ,  with over 350 pictures/entries ,  contact me by e-mail . 
1	quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids .  john thaw is brilliant as always  ( without any hint of inspector morse about him )  .  the boy playing william did a good job as well though i didn't find him convincing in every scene .  i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times .  i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate ,  as far as i could tell .   it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine .  that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii .  the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because  ( as it turns out ) she lost her daughter .  getting a boy instead she completely ignores him .  the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further .  i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr .  tom ,  it has the same feel to it . 
0	i am a huge fan of warrior movies .  some of my favorites are braveheart ,  troy ,  the last samurai and gladiator .  and after watching mongol ,  which is absolutely awesome ,  and which i strongly recommend ,  i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie .  but it was terrible ,  awful ,  even pathetic is not a strong word in this case .  the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen ,  but it didn't ,  then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end ,  but even that was a huge disappointment ,  just some random running around ,  waving with the swords .  .  .  there are so many good warrior movies ,  this one is not one of them . 
1	this wonderful 1983 bbc television production  ( not a movie ,  as others have written here )  of the classic love story  " jane eyre "  ,  starring timothy dalton as rochester ,  and zelah clarke as jane ,  is the finest version that has been made to date ,  since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue .    a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ;  when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed .  thankfully the producers of this  " jane eyre "  approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original ,  which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times ,  to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense .  the performances are delightful ,  the music is just right ,  even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful ,  and set the right tone for the production .    my only criticism ,  though slight ,  is that this version ,  like every other version ever made of jane eyre ,  ignores the christian influences that built jane's character and influenced her moral choices .  in today's modern world a woman in jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her .   " oh ,  just get a divorce "  ,  she would say to her man ,  or she would live in sin with him .  but jane eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself .  why ?  this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood ,  not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution ,  but from the christian example of a true friend ,  helen burns ,  who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek .  someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation .  a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing  " even so ,  come lord jesus !  "  should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it . 
0	first off ,  let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie :   " this entire movie had to have been a dare .  you know ,  like ,  'dude ,  i bet you couldn't make the worst movie ever' "  .  with this movie ,  they've made a good effort at achieving that title .  the effects are ,  of course ,  poor .  the plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made .  the actors ,  i'm assuming ,  are supposed to be in college .  yet parts of it  ( especially at the beginning )  make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school .  it makes no sense .  the scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable .   ( spoiler :  at the end ,  when they chant lester's name and he reappears ,  the black guy and scarecrow are both laughing ,  probably out of relief they were on their last scene ,  and at the cheesy dialogue .  ) 
1	prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese examines a selection of his favorite american films grouped according to three different types of directors :  the director as an illusionist :  d . w .  griffith or f .  w .  murnau ,  who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward ;  the director as a smuggler :  filmmakers such as douglas sirk ,  samuel fuller ,  and mostly vincente minnelli ,  directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films ;  and the director as iconoclast :  those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like orson welles ,  erich von stroheim ,  charles chaplin ,  nicholas ray ,  stanley kubrick ,  and arthur penn .   he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was ,  though oppressive ,  the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations .  during his clips from the movies he shows us ,  we not only discover films we've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees .  he evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves .   the idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish ,  hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make  " lists .  "  however ,  canon merely denotes  " the best "  and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the  " best "  films ,  a lot like a greatest hits tape ,  if just as a beginning direction for film students .  all in all ,  one's experience has shown that all writing about film ,  including reviews ,  function to construct a film canon .  some film canons can definitely be elitist ,  but others can be  " populist .  "  as an example ,  the internet movie database's top 250 movies list includes many films included on several  " elitist "  film canons but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film  " elitists "  scoff ,  like the dark knight ,  which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films ,  schindler's list and one flew over the cuckoo's nest ,  and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as iron man ,  sin city ,  die hard ,  the terminator and kill bill :  vol .  2 .  writer scorsese's taxi driver paul schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as  " elitist "  and contends that this is positive .   scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies ,  but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both ideological realms ,  we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism .  elitism concentrates all attention ,  recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding .  that discrimination could easily lead to self-indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of jean-luc godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael haneke .  yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people's will .  as has been previously asserted about the all-encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema ,  populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema .  one can only continue seeing films ,  because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice .  and that's what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us ,  something which can't be told without being seen first-hand . 
1	this is one of my favorite movies of all time .  i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise .  this movie is in some ways similar ,  but makes rain man seem artificial ,  shallow ,  unemotional ,  and trivial by comparison . 
0	hilarious ,  laugh out loud moments  .  .  .  and yet not a comedy .  i particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the  " filthy bum "  who then shouts after them in anger  " you filthy bums "  ,  i mean wow ,  someone's online degree in literature is paying off !  the worst script imaginable ,  with plot introductions in an instant ,  ridiculous movement in the story ,  zero character development  ( even between the characters who meet  .  .  it's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years )  dodgy voice over with added echo effects ,  and plot holes .  .  oh god are there plot holes !  !  to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing ,  but i certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema  .  .  .  thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence ! 
1	one word can describe this movie and that is weird .  i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting .  well it was ,  the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge .  on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not .  very strange ,  if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out . 
1	i loved the real mc coys  ( 1957-1963 )  it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear .  she was excellent in the show .  of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martínez .  i loved it when he called amos señor grampa . i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2-6 . if only there would be more shows on television like this one ,  everything would be better .  this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared .  god bless all the departed members of the cast and please , llydia reed ,  make yourself known again to the public .  you are loved and respected .  the real mc coys will live forever . 
1	since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed .  this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series  " x-files " - but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach .  but don't get me wrong ,  some of these episodes have full on horror themes ,  many in which have some pretty greuesome plots  ( left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television )  .   some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting ,  but that is the charm and attraction to this series .  whether you like mystery crime dramas ,  comedies ,  or sci-fi/horror themes ,  this series brought all that together .  each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so  ( 1 hour with commercials )  and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more .  a great classic show that is underrated in my book ! 
0	there is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film .  let's just face it ,  though ,  the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for leo and cate ,  who are not necessarily the best actors in this film .  i'm not saying they're not good actors ,  i'm saying they stunk in this film .  the special effects were decent  ( and i will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing )  ,  but it even has several major flaws .  for instance ,  right before the ship goes under ,  you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters .   don't get me wrong ,  i love the story of the real titanic ,  but i find this movie an insult to that story .  editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours  ( with the exception of maybe a biographical movie )  ,  and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted .   i will say that the music was perhaps better than i could have predicted  ( and not just the  " my heart will go on "  song either )  .  there is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard .  that could very well be the highlight of the film .  as for the mood throughout ,  it was extremely dull .  i was more relieved than sad when jack died ,  which i know cannot be what the director intended .   in a nut shell ,  i find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the titanic into an over-hyped chick flick . 
0	dynasty revisited in hawaii .  .  .  full of clichés ,  highly predictable ,  unrealistic and sometimes even stupid .  if you have nothing better to do however ,  it does provide 40 minutes of simple ,  unpretensive entertainment ,  endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery .  on the other hand ,  if you are looking for anything more than that ,  stay away .  .  .   oh ,  and by the way ,  if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one ,  you have two options :  1 .  you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or ,  2 .  look at it as science fiction comedy as i did ,  lie back ,  relax ,  and laugh about it ! 
0	i dont know about you ,  but i've always felt drawn to 'art' cinema .  the first 'art' film i managed to get a hold of was peter greenaway's  " the cook ,  the thief ,  his wife and her lover "  ,  which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive .  the film was the ultimate paradox ,  both beautiful and grotesque .  .  . this is what 'art cinema' was about ,  exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose .  life ,  real life ,  can be like living in a madhouse ,  and art expressed shows it for what it is .  i love movies of all types ,  but especially those that both entertain and have something to say ,  whether i agree with it's stance or no .  .  .    " 8 1/2 women "  ,  is a dry ,  clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies .  there is only a very brief allusion to fellini in the film ,  unlike what the previews have suggested .  the main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son ,  brought together after the mothers' death .  in the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable ,  you can feel his pain .  what happens afterwards is plain by greenaway standards ,  the gathering of the harem ,  observations on love and death ,  and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh .  .  . one could argue this ,  but i feel the movie to be shallow and pointless .  and the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me .  the acting for the most part if fine ,  .  .  . especially good are polly walker and amanda plummer ( though poor mandy should put her clothes back on )  what the film lacks is a compelling story ,  and the usual greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch .    while filled with moments of insight ,  and the occasional taboo ,   " 8 1/2 women "  is too cut and paste to be considered art ,  too bland to considered 'funny' ,  and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile .   save your money .  .  . i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid .   4 out of 10
1	series 1  as the uk eagerly awaits the launch of series two of 'lost' ,  series one  ( which just finished showing here )  did not disappoint .   a group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash-landed into a deserted island .  they pray for rescue .  however ,  as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them ,  they begin to wonder whether they are alone .   admittedly ,  the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes ,  which hurls at the group a polar bear ,  a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island .  nevertheless ,  the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode .  possibly the greatest thing about 'lost' is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks .  this gives us more insight and ,  hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present .   ultimately ,  this show is a superb combination of drama ,  suspense and the supernatural ;  it is ,  quite simply ,  unmissable .   spoilers for season 1 follow  series 2  after the cliffhanger that was the end of series 1 of 'lost' ,  series 2 begins with our protagonists delving deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatch .  they discover a mysterious man who has a job to do .  meanwhile ,  michael and sawyer struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft .   as the series progresses ,  the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set ,  as every episode of the series contains more twists than a curly-wurly chocolate bar ,  one of which introduces a whole host of new characters .  with every mystery solved with 'lost' ,  five brand new ones seem to come out of the woodworks .  after the 974th plot twist of the series ,  it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane-crash survivors make it off the island .  however ,  the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions ,  despite its anti-climatic ending . 
0	this god forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game ,  and the winner gets a million dollars .  first of all ,  the acting is terrible ,  and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all .  it is not scary in the least bit ,  it is so stupid that it made me laugh ,  which is why it earned that 1 star . the movie is not violent at all ,  but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time ,  and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny .  plus ,  the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen .  last ,  but not least the ending is terrible .  i don't want to give it away ,  in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk .  avoid at all costs !  !  !  !  !   not rated  ( but should be r )  for nudity ,  profanity ,  and mild gore . 
0	sergio leone spins in his grave .  .  .  if there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one .  the lead character's  " lone wolf "  bravado is uninspiring and lame ,  and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education .  whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped .  the only reason i'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum .  sergio leone's family should sue ,  not because its crap ,  but because now it's immortalized as crap by mst 3000 .  shame .  disgust .  i blame hollywood .  .  . at least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts .  .  . this film is pure blasphemy . 
1	tight script ,  good direction ,  excellent performances ,  strong cast ,  effective use of locations .  .  .  .   paul mcgann gives a detailed ,  subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously .   there is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character  ( ben turner )  and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton .  inevitably they cross over .  .  .  who has done what ?   the examination of why ,  both in the past and in the present ,  rather than who might have yielded a more interesting ,  dostoyevskian story ,  but hey ,  who's complaining ?   
1	whereas the hard-boiled detective stories of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern american genre and style in the process - those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever .  the problem with books like those of agatha christie ,  dorothy l .  sayers or s . s .  van dine  ( on whose work this film is based )  ,  is that they are low on action or variety - whereas sam spade or philip marlowe traverse the mean streets of la ,  working class tenements ,  bars ,  offices ,  wealthy mansions ,  and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence ,  golden age fiction is generally fixed in location ,  the scene of the murder ,  usually a lavish country house ,  and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects .  this is a very static procedure ,  plot reduced to puzzle .   this ,  of course ,  is as much ideological as anything else ,  the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement ;  the hard-boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre  ( both of authority ,  and of a city )  ,  dividing itself up into hostile ,  ever uncontrollable and lawless camps .  another major problem with golden age fiction is character - because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end ,  we cannot gain access to characters' motivations or emotions ,  being defined solely by their potential need to murder .  the detective ,  unlike the anxious ,  prejudice-ridden private eyes ,  are simply there to be brilliant ,  and maybe a little eccentric .   the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period recreations of the merchant ivory/jane austen school ,  and end up looking silly .  there have been successes ,  for example the radical reworkings of ellery queen and others by claude chabrol .  in the english-speaking world ,  there have really only been two .  the alistair sim classic ,  'green for danger' ,  works because it pushes the form almost into parody ,  while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery .   before that came michael curtiz's brilliant 'the kennel murder case' .  the narrative is pure golden age .  a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him .  he is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner ,  indicating suicide ,  slumped in a locked room .  the caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait .  it is up to philo vance ,  gentleman and amateur detective ,  neither old nor fat ,  to read the clues more insightfully ,  open the case out of the confines of the room ,  and eventually solve the case ,  the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation .   what is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining ,  and full of comical bits of business .  there isn't even really an attempt to 'subvert' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect ,  with no protest from vance ,  but that's about it .   what marks 'kennel' as a classic is its modernity .  curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur ,  because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development .  but he was hollywood's greatest craftsman ,  and he is on sensational form here .  if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle ,  curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme ,  creating an abstract variation on his source ,  reducing narrative ,  character and location to geometry ,  a series of lines ,  from the beautiful art-deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition  ,  and ,  as they glide furiously at an angle ,  jolt the dead decor to life .   this treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism ,  it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors ,  like the two central brothers ,  or the original crime itself ,  borrowed from an 'unsolved mysteries' book .  this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental relics  ( shades of 'the moonstone' ?  )  ,  inscrutable chinese servants ,  ex-cons turned butlers ,  dog-loving fops ,  runyonesque cops ,  is the perfect habitat for vance ,  a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a fanciful hunch ,  who knows the social world of these people ,  and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police ,  or would be if he wasn't anything more than a thinking machine ,  william powell ,  the greatest american comedian of the decade ,  bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity .   but if the treatment is rarefied ,  the climax is spectacularly brutal ,  involving vicious dogs and attempted murder .  the police and the detective ,  supposed to be preventing crime ,  are guilty of inciting one . 
0	those of you who ,  like me ,  were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn ,   " the fear "  will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel .  it sort of follows a similar plot ,  but it is impossible to connect to the original ,  with the exception of the presence of morty ,  the mannequin monster made of wood .  here is a brief overview .   twenty years after mike hawthorne  ( gordon currie ,  in a decent performance )  witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life ,  mike is still suffering from the fear of that day .  in hopes of ridding his fear ,  mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents' home .  his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears ,  and then present the fears to the mannequin morty .  according to an indian friend ,  this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear .  what mike doesn't know is that morty is possessed with his father's spirit ,  and begins killing off the friends .  .  . or is it really mike himself doing the killings ?  who cares ?   a have a few troubles with this film .  the first lies with morty .  i thought the original made morty look rather convincing .  this time ,  it is painfully obvious morty is a man  ( actor jon fedele )  in a fake looking suit .  this can especially be seen in early scenes ,  where morty is still supposed to be inanimate ,  but if you watch closely you can see him blinking .  another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough .  some of them do ,  namely betsy palmer ,  of friday the 13th fame ,  who was excellent in this film .  but most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance .  finally ,  there are the killings .  the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing .  actually ,  when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie .  when the second half of the movie arrives ,  and the killings really start ,  everything falls to pieces .  deaths are either uncreative ,  unseen ,  or foreseen  ( glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout )  .  one character dies in the end and no one ,  including the viewer ,  even notices .  while more characterization was needed in the beginning half ,  it wasn't too bad .  the second half was .  i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes ,  so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian .  a silly ending doesn't help either .  thus ,  unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin ,  you should probably skip  " the fear 2 :  halloween night .  "  zanatos' score :  4 out of 10 . 
1	'de grot' is a terrific dutch thriller ,  based on the book written by tim krabbé .  another of his books ,  'het gouden ei' was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called 'spoorloos'  ( 'the vanishing' )  in 1988 .  this one is not as good as that thriller  ( although much better than the american remake also called 'the vanishing' )  but there are times it comes close .   especially the opening moments are terrific .  we see a man ,  later we learn his name is egon wagter  ( fedja van huêt )  ,  coming from a plane in thailand .  when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border .  these scenes are perfectly directed ,  photographed and acted .  a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this .  later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman ,  both stating that they have never done anything like this .   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward .  we see how egon ,  still as a child  ( here played by erik van der horst )  ,  befriends a guy named axel  ( as a kid played by benja bruijning )  .  we learn how they grew up as friends ,  sort of ,  and how axel  ( as an adult played by marcel hensema )  became a criminal .  egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman .  around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .   the movie is chronological in a way .  it shows egon and axel as kids ,  than as students ,  young adults ,  and in their mid-thirties .  but from time to time ,  like i said ,  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again .  every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .   minor spoilers herein .   the title means 'the cave' ,  and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending ,  although it is in fact not that happy .  like the beginning ,  the ending is terrific .  the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes ,  only to come back at that point in the end .  it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending ,  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well . 
1	this movie surprised me ,  it had good one-liners and laughs ,  + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions .  this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns .  the plot is solid despite what others may think ,  it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end .  in conclusion ;  this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on . 
0	that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie .  cleveland is the star ,  i've been there and never saw the city look this good .  beautiful river and cityscapes .   this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you won't notice the lack of real world relevance .  people running around and shooting guns without any consequence .  for example ,  there is a shoot out at rob lowe's character's house- two cars are stolen ,  and yet the cops don't show up there till much later in the movie .  murder for hire never looked so implausible .   whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets .  many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this .  i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasn't written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case .  this movie is currently in rotation on universal's hd channel- unless you want to drool of over lowe there is no reason to watch it . 
1	this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul .  what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character ,  who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative .  yea ,  though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death ,  he fears no evil .  a rod and staff are there to comfort him .  in the end ,  he is saved from the dregs of humanity .  at the bottom is fagin ,  the most wicked of the lot .  fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once ,  but twice ,  yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price .  fagin is worse than bill sikes ,  because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers .  in the middle is oliver .  his innocence is unsullied ,  but untried as well .  the best is nancy .  lacking in judgment ,  she ignores bill sikes' violent nature out of her deep need for love .  yet unlike fagin ,  at the probable cost of her own life ,  she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill .  things are not as they seem .  in my opinion ,  this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unpredictability .  i would give this film a  " 10 ,  "  but its '70's made-for-tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting .  overall ,  a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences . 
1	i was a fan of the book ever since third grade ,  so of course i had watched the movie ,  read the sequel ,  and then watched the television show .  it was a good show in itself ,  and now as an adult i still enjoy the show .  my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book .  the first time i saw it ,  i was so disappointed that i turned it off .  but that's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book .  but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book  ( kind of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies )  .  i found the series wonderful !  it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy ,  just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going .  it is truly enjoyable !  clean and wonderful ! 
0	we all have seen some unending epics in our times ,  but this one really tops them all !  the movie is so long and so slow ,  that ,  just to put things in perspective ,  i felt a lot older when i left movie hall ,  than i entered it .  at almost 4 hours length ,  it could have rather been made into a tele-serial .   what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace .  nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them .  .  .  there is no interconnection between them to start with ,  and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story .   situation is made worse by silly dialogues  ( most of them repeated in hindi cinema over years ) and stupid cinematography .   priyanka doesn't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen .  .  .  an utter waste of beauty without acting skills .   and then there is loud-is-humorous govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-jim-carrey akshay khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers .   only good part in movie is john & vidya's love story & nice acting/comedy by sohail & isha .  but they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters .  their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines .   my guess - director was making two separate movies ( may be more !  )  and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records ,  beyond a point of sorting them out ,  so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie .  .  .   watch it only if you want to test your patience !  !  ! 
0	sure ,  if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world ,  she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world .  she's right ,  at least in her own world .   the producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend puffy .  oh ,  well ,  do i need to say more ?  i'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple deduction .   the whole movie was fake .  you may just put a few biggie's mtv video together and call it a movie .   the beautiful angela bassett played biggie's mother .  the real one in life looks like a dog .   i just wonder why he called himself biggie small .  big body small dick ?  big mouth small sound ?  big fat small eyes ?  disclaimer :  i'm a person of color .  so keep your racist remark to yourself . 
0	honestly ,  this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen .  partly ,  because it takes itself so seriously ,  as opposed to regular light hearted trash ,  this movies wants you to be emotionally involved ,  to feel for the characters ,  and to care about the alleged conspiracy .  none of this ever even comes close to happening .   ****mild spoilers******  there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible :  1 .  )  incoherent and totally non-sensical plot .  2 .  )  annoying style-over-substance  " mtv "  camerawork .  3 .  )  moronic characters and plot holes .   allow me to elaborate .   1 .  )  apparently ,  when this movies was being made ,  they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies ,  the stigmata ,  or possession .  so ,  guess what ?  they combined them !  an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person ,  who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy .  how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained ,  nor even talked about .  now ,  instead of just saying what he wants to say ,  he gives her the stigmata .  why ?  why not just spit it out ?  instead ,  we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices ,  carving cryptic messages on cars ,  and writing messages on walls .  apparently this priest was also a violent guy ,  because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters ,  while talking in that cliched ,  harsh ,   " possessed "  voice that we all have heard countless times .  this also starts to tie into my second complaint ,  because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata ,  she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air ,  and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake ?  why does this happen ?  who knows !  ?  !  my guess is that the director thought it looked  " cool "  .   2 .  )  this movies contains dozens of shots ,  in slow motion ,  of course ,  of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off ,  and most annoyingly ,  of water dripping .  this woman's apartment is constantly dripping water !  constantly !  logically ,  the place would probably fall apart with this many holes .  to sum up this complaint ,  towards the end ,  and for absolutely no reason ,  the camera cuts to shots of water dripping ,  in slow motion ,  in reverse !  !  why !  ?  !  i have no idea !  it has no relevance to anything ,  and once again ,  i'm betting it's because the director thought it looked  " cool "  .   3 .  )  one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science .  this doesn't make sense to me .  i would think that going to church would be enough ,  but no ,  he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest .  i just don't buy it .  secondly ,  there are lots of plot holes ,  a few of which i will elaborate on below .  for starters ,  when she first gets the stigmata ,  the scene ends with her laying unconscious ,  bleeding .  next ,  she's in the hospital .  who called the ambulance ?  another one is towards the end ,  when the previously mentioned  " scientific priest "  character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl .  he says ,   " take me as your messenger !  "  not a word for word quote ,  but you get the idea .  his response ?   " you have no faith ,  only doubt !  "  so ,  because of this ,  he possesses an aetheist !  an aetheist has no faith ,  far less then any scientific priest !  and then ,  there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy ,  this lost gospel  ( of st .  thomas ,  i believe )  is available at local bookstores .  the characters are willing to kill to supress this document ,  but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it .  maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history ,  where it isn't wide known ,  but the movie never tries to tell us this ,  or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document's uncovering .   in closing ,  this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree .  it is my arch-nemesis ,  which i feel the need to insult every chance i get .  i loathe it .  final grade :  f
0	i hated the way ms .  perez portrayed puerto ricans !  we are not all ghetto - and we do speak spanish- not puerto rican !  i can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into .  but our language is intact ,  our island is our pride .  puerto rico is better off economically than any other caribbean island !  i'm glad we are not like cuba ,  dominican republic or haiti ,  free from american influence ?  free in true poverty ,  not the u . s .  standard of poverty .  we are not victims we are resilient ,  humble , honest and intelligent people .  our ancestry does include strong african roots ,  but not  " black "  roots- i have nothing in common with black americans 9do the research )  .   the analogy between pedro albizu ,  che guevarra and martin l .  king could not be more off the mark .   mlk was a great hero a true revolutionary- an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free .   che guevarra helped castro create the cuba that is today ,  is that why boat fulls of cubans risk their lives to come to america- because che made such a better place for them ?  you had a great ,  awesome ,  bright idea but you politicized it too much .  we have so many things to be proud of as a people - don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us .  i am not a nuyorican and perhaps that is why i can't share your views .  i am puerto rican ,  i speak spanish ,  i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america .  if there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many .   damaris maldonado
1	 " midnight cowboy "  was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic .  you know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song ,  'everybody's talking' starts up on the soundtrack ,   ( actually not written for the film )  ,  and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck ,   ( naked and in the shower )  .  we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him ?  this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else ,  his performance here would still be legendary .  as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen ;  even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish  " anaconda "  is a source of pleasure )  .   the film became famous and infamous almost overnight .  it was a crowd-pleaser ,   ( even with its downbeat ending )  ,  funny and sexy and recognizably 'real' ;   ( it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true )  .  it was also the first 'x' rated film to win the oscar as the year's best picture .  adapted ,   ( brilliantly )  ,  by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial american movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner .  everyone is recognizably human ,  warts and all ,  and everyone is treated sympathetically .  voight's joe buck is an innocent abroad ,  a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler ,   ( a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy ;  he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker )  .  but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy ,  wormy little con-man called 'ratso' rizzo ,   ( dustin hoffman ,  fresh from  " the graduate "  and he's a revelation )  ,  he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream .   essentially it's a male love story ,   ( though totally platonic )  ,  between these two not so unlikely bedfellows .  both totally alone ,  both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other ,   ( voight with his physical prowess ,  hoffman with his street-wise savvy )  .  they are misfits adrift from the mainstream ,  tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others .  though 'straight' voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself .   ( the whole film posits a strangely 'christian' attitude )  .   it's also magnificently acted .  while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver ,  bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on ,  beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye-view of the american under-belly without rancor and without criticism .  on second thoughts ,  maybe it is a great movie after all . 
1	i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do .  this film was void of all the video whore clichés ,  and it also skipped the gangsters ,  rappers ,  and foul language .  it examined several relationships among physicians ,  african americans ,  and african american male/female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level .  i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues .  the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time .  i saw it at the boston film festival as well .  it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences .  black people  ( and everyone else )  would love a movie like this- if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there !   as an extra- if your a doctor ,  a resident ,  a medical student ,  a premedical student ,  married to a doctor ,  have a doctor sibling ,  have a doctor in the family ,  or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well .  it portrayed residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors ,  residents ,  and medical students who viewed the film .  dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent . 
1	as i reach the  " backside "  of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed ,  drug influenced teens of today .  it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today .  this film drives that point home to the core .  if you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film .  from kiss-posters to an angel concert this movie rocks  !    watch for a young laura dern .  why they didn't have more songs from the runaways i'll never know  ?    i did have a problem with randy quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl .  while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house .  the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff .   foxes belongs right there with over the edge ,  fast times ,  dazed & confused ,  and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks .   i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all . 
0	a question for all you girls out there  :  if a man you`ve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you`d phone the police  ?  yeah that`s what i thought so i couldn`t swallow the idea of marti gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of connor hill  ***** mild spoilers *****  this is a really dumb story  .  connor hill`s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is connor phoning marti so he can have an alibi  ?  but there`s a massive gap in logic here  ,  couldn`t connor have employed a hit man  ?  something the prosecution seem to have ignored  .  and wasn`t there any forensics at the murder scene  ?  so why does the whole trial rest on connor phoning marti at the time of the murder  ?  dumb  .  dumb  .  dumb  .  and it`s as predictable as it is brainless  .   my abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter olympics marti gerrard is a really crap downhill skier
1	the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game .  so many people have seen this film and just don't get it ,  and i don't understand why .  while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me .  i will try to explain this without any spoilers ,  but be forewarned ,  i do talk about things that happen in the movie .   **** possible spoilers **** be forewarned ! ****  his is a life of  " large moves "  versus  " small moves "  .  he chooses natalia to be his queen ,  and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy .  listen closely to that description .   when someone asks him a question ,  he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves .   ( the flashbacks are beautifully lit ,  by the way .  )  the flashbacks are quite interesting as well ,  for they give not only his point of view as a child ,  but the point of view of the other character as well .  it's stunning .   various characters become either his helpers or his enemies ,  pawns ,  bishops and knights ,  their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on .  even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on .  beautifully done .   i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin ,  but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end .   this film is constantly working on many levels ,  which is why i endorse it .  it was a treat and a joy to watch .   if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh .  the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces .   
1	king's solomon's mines brings us patrick swayze  ( playing allan quatermain ) who has spent a lot of time in africa ,  but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son .  he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit .  in comes alison deedy  ( playing elizabeth )  whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth's father had sent her .  elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father .   there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies  ( russians )  who want the map also .   the movie holds your attention until the end .  patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress .  patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion ,  loss and despair ,  the rugged silent good man ,  anger and strength ;  in king solomon's minds his character actually smiles a few times .  i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again ,  one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong .  maybe a little dancing would help .  but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it . 
0	this was the worst film i have seen for a long time .    not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies ,  the story is obvious ,  flat and absolutely not funny .    the girls are nice though ,  but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film .   this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad ,  made for an audience that is not older than 12 .   i never visited an american college ,  but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes .   save your time ,  do something else . 
0	when you're making a thriller about witchcraft ,  i believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work .  some pictures  (  " rosemary's baby "  ,  for example )  have accomplished this ;  others  ( like  " necromancy "  )  haven't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy .  this film does have some atmospheric moments ,  but about half the dialogue is hard to make out  ( sometimes it's poorly recorded ,  at other times just incomprehensible )  and orson welles ,  who gets top billing ,  has a role that is so beneath him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work .  or maybe he was simply having fun .  .  .  .  .  ( *1/2 ) 
1	although some may call it a  " cuban cinema paradiso "  ,  the movie is closer to a how green was my valley ,  a memory film mourning for a lost innocence .  the film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides  ( pro-castro ?  anti-castro ?  ,  focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family .  filled with good acting ,  in particular from mexican actress diana bracho ,  who plays keitel's wife .  a masterpiece ,  filled with references to classic movies ,  from casablanca to chaplin's city lights .  gael garcia bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story .  tv director georg stanford brown ,  in a rare return to acting  ( remember the rookies ?  )  ,  plays a homeless bum who acts as greek chorus ,  superbly .  it is a pity that this movie ,  originally titled dreaming of julia ,  has been released in the states by thinkfilm with the atrocious title of cuban blood ,  which has nothing to do with the movie . 
1	i just want to add my two cents worth ,  and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted ,  but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of damon runyon .  without the wonderfully street ,  hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960 .  damon runyon worked as a newspaper man ,  and he was from colorado ,  but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the east coast .  if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies ,  i would recommend a few other flicks from damon runyon's writings ;   " the lemondrop kid ,  "  and  " little miss marker ,  "  both feature bob hope ,  who ,  aside from his politics ,  has always been a funny man .   ( as a west coast liberal ,  i find his politics fairly funny ,  too !  )  damon runyon lives !  !  !  ! 
0	i was not entirely impressed by this film .  it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film .  i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it .  it was very slow and what was with picking robocop  ( peter weller )  as one of the main actors .  that was a sad point .   all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film .  it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out . 
0	there's a good movie lurking here ,  but this isn't it .  the basic idea is good :  to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse .  but the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved .   for example ,  our four heroes are  ( understandably )  paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind .  yet they wear surgical masks some times ,  not others .  some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person .  other times ,  they seem completely unconcerned .   worse ,  after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-be-killed world ,  these people constantly behave like total newbs .  they don't bother accumulating proper equipment ,  or food .  they're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere .  they don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers .  and after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race ,  they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes .  you have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long .  .  .  and even if they did ,  why anyone would want to make a movie about them .   so when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions ,  it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously .  their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense .   on top of all this ,  we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of chris pine .  his portrayal of an arrogant young james t kirk might have seemed shrewd ,  when viewed in isolation .  but in carriers he plays on exactly that same note :  arrogant and boneheaded .  it's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range .   on the positive side ,  the film *looks* excellent .  it's got an over-sharp ,  saturated look that really suits the southwestern us locale .  but that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin  ( and annoying )  characters .  even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre ,  you should save yourself the agony of watching carriers . 
0	'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic britain ,  rather like 'bend it like beckham' ,  or more closely ,  'east is east' ,  with which it shares a 1970s setting .  the tone is resolutely chirpy  ( in spite of the dour black country accents )  ,  but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite .  moreover ,  the portrayal of the film's central relationship ,  between an asian girl and her white friend ,  is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it .  i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer ,  this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced ,  but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story .  'east is east' was fun and sharp ;  'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison . 
0	for most younger viewers out there ,  they probably have no idea who buster keaton was .  so ,  because of this ,  they probably won't feel nearly as sad when watching this film as i did .  i happen to be a silent comedy freak--having see just about every keaton film still in existence .  my being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish .  this is because during his silent days ,  keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian .  he was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull .  however ,  in a move that movie historians still are baffled by ,  at the end of the silent era ,  keaton gave up his independence and became a stock mgm actor .  instead of being a great creative force ,  mgm now saw keaton solely as an actor--and they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great .  at first ,  these films with mgm were not that bad  ( such as the cameraman )  but with talkies ,  the studio really blew it--putting him in several films with jimmy durante .  durante's humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive .  keaton ,  in contrast ,  was quiet and based on action .  two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find .  as a result of this deadly combination ,  keaton made some truly dreadful films .   now this isn't to say that speak easily is a terrible film .  no ,  instead it's just more of a time-passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that .  in fact ,  if you go into the movie assuming it's a comedy ,  it will probably make the film harder to enjoy .  instead ,  it's sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements .  it is not a film that will produce belly laughs--especially for keaton fans .   the film begins in an odd setting .  keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching .  he knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books .  in a bizarre move ,  keaton's servant tricks him into believing keaton has received $750 , 000 from a dead relative--hoping that this would spur keaton to get out and enjoy life .  this is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work .  not terribly well ,  but it works .   keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to new york to have some fun .  on the way there ,  he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop .  because he knows nothing of the world ,  he doesn't seem to realize they stink .  and ,  because he thinks he's rich ,  keaton decides to take them all to new york to perform on broadway .  however ,  just before the show opens ,  his friends find out that keaton is not rich .  so ,  they decide not to tell keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show .  they assume that if the show is a hit ,  then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy .  however ,  they forget that the show itself stinks .  what are they to do ?  and ,  will keaton get the nice girl ,  get roped by a gold digger  ( thelma todd )  or be flat broke and alone ?  if you care ,  see the film .   as for keaton ,  he has few stunts in the film ,  though there are some dandy ones near the end .  instead ,  keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner .  there's really little to love about this film or hate .  it's just blah .  .  .  . when it should have been a heck of a lot better . 
0	it's been nearly 30 years ,  and i still hate everyone involved in this movie .  it remains the worst movie i've ever seen .   before seeing this ,  i never much minded rivers ,  one way or the other .  after seeing this movie ,  i have an allergic reaction when i accidentally see her on television .   i got dragged to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure .  however ,  coming out of the theater ,  those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie .  nearly thirty years later ,  we still carry around mental scars from this movie .   on my deathbed ,  one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better .  it never did .   if you are ever given a choice ,  you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie .   i registered for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie .  if i can save just one person from watching this ,  then my existence on this earth will have been justified . 
1	on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami ,  lisa reisert  ( rachel mcadams )  meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die .   red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats .  the premise is similar to cellular and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films .  almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense ,  the acting and the direction .  most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie .  the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots .  wes craven does a really good job behind the camera .  instead of focusing on the thrills ,  he focuses on the story and the characters .  the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about .  i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on .  red eye really shows his skills at storytelling .   red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast .  rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate .  you may even end up cheering for her out loud .  cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain .  the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive .  the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and jayma mays .   the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it .  the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape .  overall ,  the tone of the film is consistently creepy .  the screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though .  there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer .  most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head .  also ,  the ending is disappointing .  it isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better .  since the movie focuses on the characters ,  there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps .  if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed .  in the end ,  red eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer .  rating 8/10
0	there's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis .  i mean it's shakespeare's hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written .  i'm not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have  through mystery science theater 3000 .  while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie ,  in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips .  in a word ,  this german ,  made-for-tv version of hamlet is dreary .  152 minutes ?  no way !  it's too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on .  i've said it any number of times ,  but entertainment is the thing for me .  and this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining .  i will ,  however ,  give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting .  a 3/10 sounds about right to me .   as much as i enjoy mst3k ,  their comments don't help to make hamlet any more palatable .  there are a few good riffs here and there ,  but overall ,  hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k .  shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow .  as much as it pains me ,  i've got to give hamlet a 1/5 on my mst3k rating scale . 
0	this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen .  they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick .   the songs rarely move along the story .  they seem to be thrown in at random .  the flying scene with marley is pointless and ludicrous .   it's not only one of the worst movies i've seen ,  but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever seen .   it's probably only considered a classic because  " a christmas carol "  is such a classic story .  just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is . 
0	murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-tv but isn't .  considering the only actor of any note is bullock  ( although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things )  ,  it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things .  like .  .  .  remembering to lock your front door when you go out .  or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower .   bullock plays cassie mayweather ,  a cop with personal issues  ( don't they all )  .  together with her new partner  ( a wet-looking ben chaplin )  ,  she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman .  nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder .  as the investigation continues ,  a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood  ( ryan gosling )  .   the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless .  bullock ,  though she is very nice to look at ,  is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield  ( actually ,  he'd be better !  )  .  chaplin ,  for his sins ,  is a complete non-entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood .  at least gosling and pitt ,  as the conniving sneering suspects ,  acquit themselves adequately .  as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough ,  a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable  ( but illogical )  ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run .    " murder by numbers "  has absolutely nothing going for it ,  even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn't redeem it .  well ,  just a little but still not enough to save it .  forgettable ,  predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward .  as cassie probably says on her next case ,  there's nothing to see here people .  move along ,  keep moving .  .  . 
1	i've watched this movie a number of times ,  and found it to be very good .  this movie is also known as  " castle of terror "  ,   " coffin of terror "  ,  and  " dance macabre "  .  barbara steele ,  is her usual beautiful/creepy self .  george riviere ,  the male lead ,  does a good job with his role .  the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere ,  and there is a good deal of tension throughout .  the camera angles are good and the acting ,  for the most part ,  isn't bad .  this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening .  i have the dvd uncut version ,  which is far superior to the edited tv version .  grab some popcorn ,  turn out the lights ,  settle back and enjoy .  john r .  tracy
0	maybe it's the dubbing ,  or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying ,  moaning or otherwise carrying on ,  but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought  ( and therefore annoying )  films i've ever seen .  the film starts out promisingly if familiarly ,  as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son  ( sandro franchina )  .  whilst mummy and daddy  ( bland alexander knox )  entertain their guests at a dinner party ,  the youngster tries to kill himself ,  setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy .  spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea  ( ettore giannini )  ,  she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband ,  who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles .  bergman plays the saint role to the hilt ,  echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc ,  and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect .  unfortunately ,  the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety ,  as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes .  by the final tear soaked scene ,  i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters .  a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st .  francis . 
0	elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying ,  untalented self in this film .  this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy .  rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better .  james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie .  the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long .  the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up .  hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age .   0/10 . 
0	there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie .  they took a sleazy story ,  miscast it ,  miswrote it ,  misfilmed it .  it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story .   as badly as it fails as art ,  it fails even worse as commerce .  who could have been the target market for this .  what age group ?  what interest group ?   someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie .  that i would pay to see .   i've seen thousands of bad movies ,  and this ranks with  " sailor who fell from grace "  and  " manos "   .  .  .  my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies i've ever seen .  everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all eternity .   i challenge you .  watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse ?  i can't think of one way . 
0	 ( rating :  21 by the film snob .  )   ( see our blog what-to-see-next for details on our rating system .  )   here's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on-screen tedium .    you'll not be wringing your hands ,  nor rolling your eyes ,  nor sighing into your popcorn .  no indeed .  for a movie of *this* averagousity ,  only clawing at your own face will do .    when you begin to claw your own face -- as begin you must !  -- start in at the lower portion .  you'll need your upper portion ,  with its handy tear ducts ,  intact for the truly tear-jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then .    in a season celebrating joe six-pack and hockey moms as the new gold standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy ,  permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as a thing that anyone could create .  *watching* it ,  however ,  is a much more dangerous undertaking .    here's our story .  .  .    sidney young ,  the london publisher of a fourth-tier celebrity/entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under .  he needs a miracle ,  and what he gets is a phone call from new york city ,  in the usa .   the publisher of sharp's magazine ,  clayton harding  ( played by jeff bridges )  says  " come work for me !  "  with his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment/office in the background ,  saying  " yes "  is a no-brainer .   soon sidney is at work in new york city ,  doing allllllll the wrong things .  his interviews consist of asking broadway musical directors if they are  ( 1 )  jewish ,  and  ( 2 )  gay .    he kills the pet dog of sohpie maes ,  the industry's hottest movie star ,  when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon .   this is a spot of bad luck for everyone ,  for ,  among other things ,  sidney imagines that he is in love with maes ,  before he wakes up to the dunst character .   worst of all ,  he totally alienates alison olsen  ( played by winsome scripting-confusion by kristen dunst )  ,  a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine *and* the big apple .   ( we have ,  of course ,  been to a movie before ,  and so we know how this relationship is going to end up .  this is therefore why we'll need intact tear ducts for the movie's third act .  )   the problem with the thing is ,  the script just never jells ,  excepting for the one tear-duct set piece in which true love prevails .   publisher harding is supposed to be a son-of-a-bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over .  the script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy ,  however ,  and bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze .   alison olsen is supposed to despise sidney young ,  but whenever he comes up to her  ( as he does constantly )  she makes a point of engaging him in conversation ,  instead of attempting to discourage his existence .   the  " comedy "  of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room ,  and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception .   the hot starlet maes confesses that she is attracted to young because he is  " wounded .  "  the character never shows us *why* he is wounded ,  however .  this is yet another resultant of the movie's mortally wounded script .   at one hours and fifty minutes ,  this thing feels longer  ( and more deadly )  than napoleon's retreat from moscow .  it is uninspiring ,  unfunny ,  unredeemable ,  and not even rentable .  run away
0	just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival .  just before going i came here to see how it was rated ,  and at that time it was 7 . 4 ,  a pretty nice rate .  .  .   after 15 minutes i was dying to get out  ( never did this )  ,  but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening .   i did not like at all ,  the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere ,  the characters are shallower than the dialogs ,  nothing lead anywhere ,  and the worst and worst :  plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie .  despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself ,  i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top ;  or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen !  all of this would be bearable if the plot ,  characters ,  romances ,  anything was good ,  but was bad ,  really bad !  a  " don't know how to do "  sex-in-the-city .   don't waste your time or money . 
0	i noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults .  it probably earned some of them ,  but it wasn't that bad .  well ,  i'll be honest :  i never want to see this film again .  it was a bad film .  but i don't hate this film ,  it tried to tell a story .  as a drama ,  this film could work very well actually .  i just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this  ( they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy )  .  with a rewrite ,  it could have been a great film .  but as a satire ,  it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot :  for example ,  the robbery scene makes little sense in the story .  still ,  it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the top 10 worst ?  that's debatable . 
1	just saying you've got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen ,  but writer/director james cox delivers oh so much more .  a  " rashamon "  of the sleazy hollywood set ,  the film splitters the july 1981 wonderland murders through a variety of angles  ( and film stocks )  ,  but mostly through the filter of john holmes' coked out weasel brain .  in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile ,  the most pathetic or both .  several versions of the story emerge and merge as cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting .  the dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false .  while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity ,  kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches .  this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center .  those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown ,  not even at the climax , though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos .  once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working .  strutting ,  cringing ,  bragging or begging ,  kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck .  stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted levine as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa kudrow as holmes estranged wife .  the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy josh lucas ,  the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders .  cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland ,  there is always a worse version possible ,  but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth . 
1	bette midler is again divine !  raunchily humorous .  in love with burlesque .  capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever .  all in all singing new ballads ,  power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as  " the rose "  ;   " stay with me "  and yes ,  even  " wind beneath my wings "  .  the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it ,  i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries ! 
0	impenetrable rubbish .  this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  the dialogue is ghastly ,  the horror effects are laughable .  the only thing that kept me watching was the ever-splendid and totally underrated michael cule . 
0	this movie was amusing at times ,  hell sometimes it was even downright funny .   the underlying message i got from the film though ,  was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man .  every time a woman is depicted in the film ,  she is being lazy ,  being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason .  i don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men .   but ,  it is a comedy ,  and a piece of art ,  so it is simply someones point of view .  even if i don't agree with it ,  they are still entitled to it .   an amusing film ,  but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid .  best film ever my foot . 
1	wow .  .  . i don't know what to say .  i just watched seven pounds .  no one can make me cry like will smith .  the man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion .  this movie was skillfully and beautifully done .  rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today .  i would compare it to  " pay it forward "  and  " crash "  as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way .  definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about .  i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one .  not usually one for a  " bad ending "  but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion ,  raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around .  therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end .  it is true to life that there aren't always happy endings .  sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be .  many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost .  if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie ! 
1	brian dennehy ,  bill paxton ,  joe pantalino and ,  best of all ,  jeff fahey ,  all in one film .  wow is all i can think to say about that .  these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together .  it's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film .   the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time ,  and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent .  i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen ,  the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves ,  it almost brought a tear to my eyes .   a good film ,  a great cast ,  go see .  why ?  four words ,  fahey ,  dennehy ,  paxton ,  pantalino . 
1	this is the best movie i've come across in a long while .  not only is this the best movie of its kind ( school shooting ) the way ben coccio ( the director )  decided to film it was magnificent .  he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school .  he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film .  also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary .  it is almost artful .  ( if that is indeed a word ) there are a few slip ups however ,  for example when cal calls brads (  ?  )  land rover a range rover ( or vice versa ,  it's been awhile since i've seen it ) 
0	carnosaur 3 :  primal species  ( 1996 )  d :  jonathan winfrey .  scott valentine ,  janet gunn ,  rick dean ,  anthony peck ,  rodger halston ,  terri j .  vaughn ,  billy burnette .  why even bother reviewing this movie ?  another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal  ( and very fake-looking )  prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways .  the original was bad enough ,  the sequel was even worse .  this falls somewhere in between ,  though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films .  rating :  2 out of 10 .  rated r for graphic violence and gore ,  grisly images ,  and profanity . 
0	this paramount version/ripoff of oklahoma ! /annie get your gun/calamity jane isn't all that unusual or innovative .  the marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live tv show .  i don't find the use of the background cyclorama ,  lit in various scenes with yellow ,  or pink ,  or red ,  or .  .  .  . all that innovative .  as noted ,  it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget :  all soundstage ,  with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs !   ( compare to new faces  ( of 1952 )  .  the actors come off reasonably well ,  though .  and this style was much better realized when paramount shot li'l abner in 1959 .  of couorse ,  this movie suggests the often repeated question :   " what were they thinking ?  " 
0	please make me forget .  please .  please .  this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch .  i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film .  i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences .  what a load of garbage !  !  and don't get me started about the acting .  .  .  someone please help me forget !  !   " weird science "  -- come back !  !  everything is forgiven .  .  .   i am  " proud "  to give this film the first 1 here at imdb .  .  .  and i've voted for hundreds of films .  .  .  many of them c**p but this is so bad i can't even believe it .  someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film ?  someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film ?  someone read the script and auditioned for it ?  someone saw the film and decided *not* to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity ?  *these* are the questions i want answers to .  not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well ,  you know .  .  . 
1	in the fifties the age restrictions for films in brazil were the following :  no restriction ,  10 years old ,  14 years old and 18 years old .  usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old ,  when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14 ,  but it was rare to see a western restricted for younger than 18 .  winchester 73 was one of those ,  and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average .  the hero ,  james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father .  he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized ,  far from the average good guy .  anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart .  shelley winters ,  the leading lady was far from virtuous ,  she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle .  dan duryea as waco johnnie dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered .  the story of the film ,  which always follows the man who stays with the rifle ,  is one of the best suited for a western .  it was to be made into a fritz lang film ,  which did not come through .  when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang .  with winchester ,  mann created a different conception of western ,  but still maintaining all its traditions .  winchester still is a great film to see again and again ,  but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released . 
0	and thats about all that is .  this thing is slow .  the actors have ability ,  they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort .  the plot isn't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all .  the accents ,  when there are any ,  are british .  uh ,  lots of these folks are supposed to be danes .  ok ,  ok ,  accents aren't that important .  but language is .  i don't think they used words like  " yeah "  and  " ok "  in beowulf's day .  and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him ?  did he ever reload that thing ?  did he ever sight it in ?  or was beowulf just that bad an aim ?  well ,  his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters .  those were rather off too .  bad special effects .  bright spot ?  just one that i can think of .  marina sirtis has held up well over the years . 
1	most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets .  the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings ,  stairs ,  doors ,  furniture and so forth .  it is worth paying attention to .  the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich .  all the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat .  the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way .  this is a film buff's film .  it was made by people ,  for people who love the medium .  don't miss this one . 
0	this foolish ,  implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears :  he is dead .  perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a .  martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment .  that a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver .  his moment is brief ;  his promise is immense .  perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film . 
0	i wanted to punch the tv .  watching it was torture .  i hated it .  never watch this movie .  the terrorists are annoying .  adam sandler is annoying .  i normally like him but not in this one .  i wanted to break the dvd .  this is the most irritating film in the world .  the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious .  the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls .  it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv .  do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone .  if you even like adam sandler a little bit ,  don't buy it .  it will just make you hate him .  do yourself a favor ,  if you see it in the store ,  hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it .  its a waste of the $1 . 99 i paid for it . 
0	this movie is really goofy !  i saw it as an 11 year old ,  and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous !  i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 .  i really didn't care for it ,  but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of ,  such as :  1 ) does money buy happiness ?  2 ) should i lie  ( to my parents )  about things i think they wouldn't approve of ?  3 ) does money buy friendships ?  4 ) is money everything ?  5 ) shouldn't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me ?  granted ,  these are very unrealistic situations ,  but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children ,  maybe they should watch this video as well ,  in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt . 
0	robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members .  however ,  the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a  " must see .  "  i think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel noon ( i had to spell it this way ,  because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to  " no one "  )  character .  the movie runs a little over 01 : 30 and within the first 15 minutes ,  or so it seems ,  noon begins his search for pete logande ,  the boy caller .   this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times .  the conversations aren't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you .  .  .  i'm in the hospital .  .  . why did you boyfriend move out .  .  .  etc .  in the book ,  the kid almost becomes noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy ,  once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax .   in the movie ,  noon becomes obsessed with finding logande ,  but the audience is left to wonder why ?  since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller ,  why bother ?  who cares if the caller doesn't exist ?    i know there's a difference between a book and a movie ,  but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen ,  because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie .  since it doesn't ,  the movie falls apart .   this is surprising because of maupin's other work ,  tales of the city .  when it was made into a mini-series ,  it worked beautifully . 
0	there are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that :    1 )  the people who made this documentary  ( including the director and the producer )  are serbs or of serbian origin ,  therefore the criteria of neutrality fails .  for instance ,  they mentioned that the diaspora croats  ( the so called  " ustase "  )  played a huge part in the fall of yugoslavia ,  but they didn't mention that there were equal serbian organizations as well  ( cetniks )  !  for you who aren't that familiar with balkan ww2 history :  the serbian so called  " cetniks "  that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped british paratroops during the war .  well ,  that's only half the truth .  they were also a fascist  ( monarch )  group who collaborated with the germans ,  but then switched side when hitler started losing the war .  it's also ironic that they don't mention the cetnik leader mihajlovic in the documentary ,  a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over bosnia and croatia .  but they mentioned a certain ante pavelic .  .  . hm .  .  . allow me to be just a little suspicious .   2 )  most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown .  and i've studied this war for a long time  ( who is the old british lady !  !  !  she really hasn't made her homework !  )  and they are not even presented by name ,  so they could more or less be anybody ,  maybe someone they took from the street .  who knows .   3 )  in the documentary they talk about kosovo and how the serbs have lived there for ages ,  and therefore it should belong to serbia  ( even though they are a minority )  .  well ,  when they mention the serbian dominated part of croatia  ( krajina )  suddenly the serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long .  fine ,  but what people don't know is that the largest city in krajina  ( knin )  has great historical importance for the croatian people .  it was there where one of the most celebrated kings of croatian history  ( zvonimir )  was crowned ,  and therefore the city has a historical value for croatia .  the serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later !  but no ,  the serbs should have krajina and kosovo according to the documentary .  is that fair ?  to me it looks like double standards of morality from the director .  plus ,  it is said in the documentary that the croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights ,  this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented because of the fact that croatia had a huge serbian minority .   4 )  the film mentions a radical croatian paramilitarian leader called glavas .  or the muslim radical oric .  they accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war .  yes ,  they were radicals ,  but if you want to talk about radicals ,  why not also mention the serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as seselj and arkan ?  the flaws are so many that i just presented a few of them ,  just so that people get an overview of the documentary .  it looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the serbs because they were afraid that their serbian relatives would slap them or something .  there aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality ,  but the best so far is  " the death of yugoslavia "  where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed  ( e . g .  milosevic ,  jovic ,  bulatovic ,  tudman ,  izetbegovic ,  karadzic etc .  )  and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of yugoslavia and the war .   one other thing .  i saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the us gave support to a country  ( bosnia )  that had connections with bin laden during the war .  well ,  first of all ,  all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the bosnian muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity  ( previosly they were called  " muslim croats "  )  they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people ,  and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common :  their religion .  and they took help from the mujahedin because no one else would support them .  they had to fight the 4 : th largest army in europe !  they needed all the help they could get .  nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war .  history has shown us that . 
1	this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad ,  unfortunate death at the box office .  i saw this film at a local art cinema , in revival form , shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas .  it certainly deserves to be approached a second time  ( or even a third )  .  sandra b .  takes it to the limit by doing spoken word & taking on some well known songs in this piece  ( her version of hank william's 'i'm so lonesome i could cry' could easily move you to tears )  .  maybe someday ,  audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously  ( but not without some well placed laughs , too )  .  the film moves at a brisk pace  ( thanks to some nice editing )  , so that some viewers will not find it stale & boring .  perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline . 
0	watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment .  it's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed .   i'm sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie .  oops .  that's not what happened .   the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released .  when it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity .  if i remember correctly ,  in houston it opened at drive-ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues .   i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne ,  who was hot after having directed  ( the not all that good )  joanna ,  a film with music about young people in swinging mod london .   if i recall correctly ,  fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could .  that's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish .  an impressive supporting cast  ( kathleen freeman ,  jim backus ,  john carradine ,  andy devine and others )  is wasted with nothing to do .   to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda  ( in amazing footage from the gang's all here )  andlaurel and hardy ,  who never dreamed they'd be playing in an x rated movie .   the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions ;  however ,  none of the characters seem to be having any fun .  maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them .   this was one of the  " youth "  pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970's .  one writer joked that easy rider  ( which was made for pocket change )  was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success .  sixtyish ,  once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience .  white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience .  those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never ,  as best i know ,  been out on home video or cable .  they're the studios' deep dark secret .   raquel welch's performance in this is ,  all things considered ,  very good .  with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in .  she looks great and has awesome costumes .  mae west is the liveliest seventy-something actress i've ever seen .  on the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by ,  but i'm sure she needed the money .   if you want to see a big budget x-rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls  ( also from fox )  because it doesn't take itself seriously .  it's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio .  myra breckinridge tries to say something .  there just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen . 
0	before seeing this movie ,  i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done .  now it's everything-minus-one .  james woods is pathetic .  .  . not his character ,  his acting .  someone should've told him that  " poor "  is not synonymous with dirty ,  nor ignorant ,  nor cliche .  ditto for randy quaid's stereotyping .  the only redeeming feature is henry thomas ,  who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess .  if you enjoy the country ,  you'll enjoy the scenery .  that's the best i can give it .   i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films ,  but this is simply terrible . 
0	this tv-made thriller is all talk ,  little action .  it works hard to set up its convoluted plot ,  yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best .  by the end ,  i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning .  it has a quasi- " ten little indians "  scenario ,  but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer .  field overacts here with a gracelessness i've seldom seen from her .  the early introductions are good ,  but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top .  lots of hysteria ,  and constant thunder and lightning effects  ( which adds nothing )  .  a curious failure from producers aaron spelling & leonard goldberg .  with all this talent ,  couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet ? 
1	i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me . to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot . hahahaha .  .  . but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death " i was inside you "  . i think that's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were .  ? now i don't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that . but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way . and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store . hahahahaha . she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello !  !  it's called back-up . sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things . but that's what i think an thought about the movie . 
1	 " scoop "  is also the name of a late-thirties evelyn waugh novel ,  and woody allen's new movie ,  though set today ,  has a nostalgic charm and simplicity .  it hasn't the depth of characterization ,  intense performances ,  suspense or shocking final frisson of allen's penultimate effort  " match point ,  "   ( argued by many ,  including this reviewer ,  to be a strong return to form )  but  " scoop "  does closely resemble allen's last outing in its focus on english aristocrats ,  posh london flats ,  murder ,  and detection .  this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy ,  and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian ,  a magician called sid waterman ,  stage moniker the great splendini ,  who counters some snobs' probing with ,   " i used to be of the hebrew persuasion ,  but as i got older ,  i converted to narcissism .  "  following a revelation in the midst of splendini's standard dematerializing act ,  with scarlett johansson  ( as sondra pransky )  the audience volunteer ,  the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalist's post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story .  on the edge of the styx joe strombel  ( ian mcshane )  has just met the shade of one lord lyman's son's secretary ,  who says she was poisoned ,  and she's told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman  ( hugh jackman )  was the tarot card murderer ,  a london serial killer .  sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths .  with sid's deadpan wit and sondra's bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracy .   woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse -- as in  " match point ,  "  johansson again -- as in the past .  this time moreover scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star .  she's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy ,  bespectacled but still pretty coed .  sid and sondra have no flirtation ,  which is a great relief .  they simply team up ,  more or less politely ,  to carry out strombel's wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt .  with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondra's dad .  sondra ,  who's captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool ,  re-christens herself jade spence .  mr .  spence ,  i . e .  ,  woody ,  keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks ,  but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker ,  spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining ,  apparently with success ,  that he's in oil and precious metals ,  just as  " jade "  has told him to say .   that's about all there is to it ,  or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome .  at first allen's decision to make johansson a gauche ,  naively plainspoken ,  and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision .  but johansson ,  who has pluck and panache as an actress ,  miraculously manages to carry it off ,  helped by jackman ,  an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable ,  if he desires her .  the film actually creates a sense of relationships ,  to make up for it limited range of characters :  sid and sondra spar in a friendly way ,  and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and tainted  ( she is ,  after all ,  going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac )  .   what palls a bit is allen's again drooling over english wealth and class ,  things his brooklyn background seems to have left him ,  despite all his celebrity ,  with a irresistible hankering for .  jackman is an impressive fellow ,  glamorous and dashing .  his parents were english .  but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia  (  " x-man's "  wolverine )  really pass as an aristocrat ?  only in the movies ,  perhaps  ( here and in  " kate and leopold "  )  .   this isn't as strong a film as  " match point ,  "  but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong .  it has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a tv show ,  but woody's jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair ,  and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness .  it doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment .  on a hot day you don't want a heavy meal .  the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment ,  without crude jokes or bombastic effects ;  without vince vaughan or owen wilson .  critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded  " match point .  "  don't believe them .  he doesn't try too hard .  why should he ?  he may be 70 ,  but verbally ,  he's still light on his feet .  and his body moves pretty fast too . 
0	i ,  too ,  was fooled by the packaging .  i ,  too ,  fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims  " grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves "  .  though it was inexpensive  ( $6 . 99 )  ,  it wasn't really all that worth it - no scares ,  and very limited gore .  the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have .  i really don't even know how it became a  " video nasty "  with how very tame it is .  the story drags ,  the characters are obvious amateur actors .  .  . it doesn't live up to the promise .  the dvd bonus feature  ( the  " interview "  ) is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there .  the lead actress talks like she's appearing in a shakespearean production .  it's a great laugh . 
1	the last of the blond bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff .  judy dench plays elizabeth ,  a newly widowed woman at loose ends .  she has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happy .   shortly after her husband's funeral ,  elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick-in-the-mud children when she spots a street performer .  this sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in london during world war ii .  we soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala some like it hot .   elizabeth pulls out her sax  ( which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage )  and joins forces with the guitar-playing street musician .  elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist ,  and the money begins to flow in .  she doesn't take any money as she is wealthy and doesn't need it .  her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment .   elizabeth is seen one day by patrick  ( ian holm )  who was the drummer-in-drag of the band .  it seems that patrick was - and still is - quite the ladies' man ,  and elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience patrick's  " talents "  other than drumming .   elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughter's school dance .  thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all topped off with some really good swing and blues .   i guess i'm at the age in which i really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff ,  and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars judi dench ,  but she is supported by none less than olympia dukakis ,  leslie caron ,  and a host of seasoned british character actresses .  this is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of cleo laine .   yes ,  it is fluff ,  but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff . 
0	i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything .  batman tas may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet .  it's just too damn good .  was batman beyond good ?   " yeah ,  but it was no tas .  "  is justice league good ?   " it's not too bad ,  but it's no tas .  "   the batman is certainly no tas ,  either ,  but i won't hold that against it .  it would be unfair and besides ,  it has plenty of other problems with it .   the concept of a younger ,  less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one ,  and at times the art is very nice .  but all of the rest of the time ,  the art is worthless americanime ,  and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself .  it is paced ,  written ,  and designed like an americanime .  if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures ,  i'd watch jackie chan adventures .  or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect .  the joker is a homicidal ,  mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits ,  unpredictability ,  and clever gadgets to fight batman .  when he is forced to fight hand to hand ,  he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched .  he is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air ,  accompanied by speed lines .  if they had wanted to do that with a villain ,  there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely .  and it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing ,  don't get me wrong .  tas  ( there i go again )  took mr .  freeze from your standard icegun-wielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character .  of course freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade ,  but the point stands .  what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and lore and takes a large ,  smelly dump on them .  guess what ?  they were eating corn .   it's obvious this show can't stand against tas but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me .  the plots aren't good and they don't develop any better .  they've been written for the demographic of children under twelve .  should children be able to enjoy a show ?  of course they should .  this shouldn't be an adult show with swearing ,  nudity ,  and gratuitous violence .  but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages .  this show misses that mark .   is this show a tas ?  no ,  of course not .  the problem is it's not even a jlu . 
0	although i recently put this on my 10 worst films list ,  i have to say it's probably no worse than burt reynolds in  " the maddening "  or any of the  " look who's talking "  sequels .  still ,  it's pretty nauseating ,  even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to holly golightly ,  relocating from new york city to los angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look-alike .  poor sally kellerman ,  a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s ,  is reduced here to a paltry supporting role ,  and barrymore's leading man george newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor ,  always pausing for a laugh after every line .  the picture is swill ,  but drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship ,  and the identity of the psycho  ( although right out of a  " scooby doo "  episode )  is interesting .  but as for the finale .  .  . get real !  who had to clean up that mess ?  * from ****
0	1940 .  - a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi-occupied poland ,  recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co-operation of the jewish community ,  is combined with archival footage ,  clips from international newsreels ,  and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world's jews as swindlers and parasites .  this 'documentary' interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-semitism and nazi ideology .  a candid ,  cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred .  i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive .  one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again . 
0	this movie sucked .  it really was a waste of my life .  the acting was atrocious ,  the plot completely implausible .  long ,  long story short ,  these people get  " terrorized "  by this pathetic  " crazed killer "  ,  but completely fail to fight back in any manner .  and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip ,  with no gear ,  and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones .  additionally ,  after their boat goes missing ,  they panic that they're stuck in the woods ,  but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them .  like i said ,  this movie sucks .  a complete joke .  don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it . 
0	i cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children's television show ,  power rangers is all about .   i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place ,  since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever .   the costumes look completely atrocious ,  like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym .   what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways ,  but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems ?  what is up with the awful hair cuts ,  and clothing on this show anyway ?  not to mention this show is still playing on cable television ,  just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem .   there's far better entertainment for today's children ,  hopefully they aren't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show .   oh ,  and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway ? 
0	i've been using imdb for a few years now ,  but have never written any reviews before .  however ,  this movie so disappointed me  ( even with a modest score of 6 . 4 at the time of writing )  that i couldn't keep quiet anymore .   noise is the story of a new yorker  ( tim robbins ) who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante ,   " the rectifier "  ,  and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding .   i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer .  although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned ,  the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms .  car alarms ,  car alarms ,  car alarms .  there is really no other focus .  when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms ,  it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins' character .    yes ,  we're all annoyed by noise .  nobody likes the sound of car alarms .  of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle ,  and this movie uses that fact ,  and pretty much that fact alone ,  to sell this movie .  i say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship  ( including a completely needless threesome )  which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie .  honestly ,  it's eye-rolling .   robbin's character ,  very shortly into the movie ,  becomes completely unrelatable .  it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore ,  and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity .  the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry ,  car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy ,  the rectifier .  however .  .  .  the transformation doesn't take place .  he just renames himself .   i could go on for a while .  annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie ,  and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either .    overall ,  i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be ,  as it's pretty much shoved down your throat ,  but in my opinion ,  it fails in a big way .  just one guy's opinion ,  cheers . 
1	here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite ,  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity .  this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness ,  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name ,  as far as a  " romance "  between the giant  ( here a yeti )  and a gorgeous human female  ( antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi's city of the living dead ,  who is very easy on the eyes )  .   the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package ,  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness .  but as a trade-off you do get a wacky old scientist ,  two inquisitive kids ,  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain ,  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  ( dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while )  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti ,  who turns out to be the good guy ,  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands ,  a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot ,  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison ,  crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either spanish ,  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  ( you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed )  ,  and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie .   it's here that the film won me over :  it's enthusiasm just for being made .  frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and god's gun the year before this & was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work .  i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever ,  or rather the one he took the most chances with ,  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families .  the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless .  or rather they are part of the fun ,  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- which is exactly why peter jackson's movie sucked .    he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators ,  and with all it's faults + clunkiness ,  kramer's yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this ,  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages ,  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space .  i'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it !  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever .  because the movie looks so  " fake "  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked ,  trampled ,  tossed about and smashed .  knowing that and armed with a fertile ,  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie ,  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend .  this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid .   10/10 ,  it's about ten minutes too long but who cares ,  you only come around once and i'd rather go out with a smile on my face . 
0	mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 .   well ,  the movie mainly takes place in 1986 .  the movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects ,  including some weird demented looking rocking horse .   anyway ,  mary lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body .  whether or not she succeeds ,  you'll have to watch to find out .   anyway ,  the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters .  this also isn't really a sequel ,  the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school .  it has the avg .  horror flick fall backs ,  gore ,  pointless nudity ,  knocks against the catholic church .  basic stuff ,  boring movie .   the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 .  you can waste your time doing something else . 
1	this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek ,  but is different in its less cartoony feel  ( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures )  .  the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end  ( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves )  but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different  " animals .  "  you know the outcome ,  but you can't help being drawn in .    the characters themselves are far more than their voices  ( the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices )  ,  unlike most disney movies .  they are well rounded and completely believable ,  strangely .  the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable .  you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think .    the animation is brilliant ,  as you would expect ,  and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie .  you will fall in love with the characters ,  especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts .  i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise ,  especially the sloth toy ,  only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related .   which ,  strangely ,  makes the movie all the more pure .    better than monsters inc or shrek . 
0	this starts off bad ,  what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin ,  endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story ,  and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14  ( she's the headmistress of an english school ,  believe it or not )  ,  only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend'  .   .  . and then from there ,  it's basically unwatchable claptrap :  she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started ,  drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah .  andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street ,  in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth .  have mercy . 
0	this film was hard to get a hold of ,  and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming .  i mean ,  this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century :  an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt .  with all of this built-in interest ,  how could anyone make such a lackluster ,  talk-laden flick of this true-life event .  while williams is always interesting ,  the screenwriters assumed that the d . b .  cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star ,  s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off .  harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty ,  but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction .  shame on this film for even existing . 
0	why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it ?  they ask why hollywood isn't making the money it used to .  because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage .  the tv show was what it was ,  good people in bad situations where the good il' boys come out on top .  it wasn't gone with the wind but it was fun .  this movie is garbage !  hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$ .  i only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make .  the only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the general lee .  the audience is the victim .   don't see it ,  watch the reruns of the tv show instead .  they still hold up 20 years later . 
1	i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy ,  however that is not to say it wasn't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear .  it's set in 16th century brazil ,  where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance .  what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french .  the hero is a likable frenchman ,  the portuguese are barbarians ,  and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy .  the film's portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done ,  we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes .  it's about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes .  enemies are made and perpetuated ,  and like so ,  the environmental integration never progresses .   a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe ,  the tupinambas ,  after they massacre a group of portuguese .  the tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball .  thinking the frenchman is portuguese ,  they believe they now have one .  nevertheless ,  the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village ,  is sooner or later given a wife ,  and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes ,  or any clothes .  another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese ,  then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearby .   i found the opening scene funny ,  because its narration apposed with its contradictions on- screen serve as great satire ,  even if the movie didn't seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often .  it's actually not a terribly riveting film .  the bountiful ,  essential locale ,  fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman ,  but us ,  too ,  forget any threat ,  and we have the feeling of him as a free man .  it should not be that terribly hard to escape .  the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the full-frontal nudity of the cast ,  suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santos's dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence .  at any rate ,  this 1500s-era social commentary ,  shot on location at a bay with 365 islands ,  played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi ,  encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because they've repeated themselves for centuries . 
1	if you  " get it "  ,  it's magnificent .   if you don't ,  it's decent .   please understand that  " getting it "  does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting .  there is so much more to this movie that ,  at times ,  the school shooting becomes insignificant .   above all ,  it's a movie about acceptance ,  both superficially--of a traumatic event ,  but also of people who are different for whatever reason .   it's also a movie about unendurable pain ,  and how different people endure it .  in this case ,  the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat .  thankfully ,  the audience is given credit for being human beings ;  our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy ,  implausibly moralistic ending .   above and beyond that ,  i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that .  yet i must admit ,  i cried like a lost little baby during this movie .  there were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed .  but that is not necessarily a bad thing . 
1	   " burning paradise "  is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism .  when one watches the film ,  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter ,  it's attitude and atmosphere that counts .  this great film has both !  !  always trying to be different than his contemporaries ,  lam gives us to traditional heroes ( fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan ) and puts them in a  " raiders of the lost ark "  setting .  however ,  these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie .  instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results .  what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime ,  there is no holding back .  too bad ,  they don't make films like this more often . 
1	this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .   
1	i love ghost stories in general ,  but i particularly love chilly ,  atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories .  this one qualifies on all counts .  a naive young lawyer  (  " solicitor "  in britspeak )  is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly ,  deceased woman's estate .  it's the 1920s ,  a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for  " their health .  "  well ,  guess what ,  there's nothing  " healthy "  about the village of crythin gifford ,  the creepy site of the elderly woman's hulking ,  brooding victorian estate ,  which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh .  when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl  ( none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film )  ,  he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit ,  the woman in black .  she is no filmy ,  gauzy wraith ,  but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil .  the viewer only sees her a few times ,  but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame .  as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers ,  you expect to see the woman in black at any moment .  when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house ,  the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there ,  too .  waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful .  we've seen many elements of this story before ( the locked room that no one enters ,  the fog ,  the naive outsider who ignores the locals' warnings )  but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story .  watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black .   .   . 
1	daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor .  he is brilliant as christy brown ,  a man who has cerebral palsy ,  who then learned to write and paint with his left foot .  a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother .  hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father .  worth watching for the outstanding performances . 
1	personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem .  way back in the eighties ,  the early eighties ,  i discovered this movie ,  like so many released at the time ,   " night patrol "   " bad manners "  or even  " king frat "  the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you .   of course being of an age ,  movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like  " screwballs "  and the many others ,  captured the imagination ,  and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches .   made many years after the huge success of  " animal house "  and having seen how it had fared down through the years ,  i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory ,  much like that of national lampoon's vacation .   to be honest ,  not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success ,  however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies ,  with instantly recognisable characters ,  such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham ,  so good in charles band's  " terrorvision "  still lingering in the past glories of his youth .  or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs .   sweet as .  which makes me ponder .  as i already said ,  personal taste not withstanding .  people can be so cruel ,  so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world .  it does have some merit .  being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes ,  who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work  " weird science "  as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u . s bonds .   what more can i say ,  it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered ,  time and time again . 
1	this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut .  the plot is fairly thin .  what drives the film is the characters ,  excellently played by mostly unknown actors .  standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper .  the two actresses give natural performances and work well together .  this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton .  the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip .  the film title and poster suggest something raunchy ,  but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama . 
1	panic delivers the goods ten fold with oscar caliber performances from william h macy ,  neve campbell ,  and donald sutherland .  in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with .  chillingly honest and thought provoking ,  panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years .  the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater . 
1	one of the great classic comedies .  not a slapstick comedy ,  not a heavy drama .  a fun ,  satirical film ,  a buyers beware guide to a new home .   filled with great characters all of whom ,  cary grant is convinced ,  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .   a great look at life in the late 40's .   
1	when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas ,  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film .  yet ,  having read the content ,  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie .  the effect surprised me totally :  i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me .  a vow to cherish is ,  without any doubt ,  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema .  here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .    first ,  the entire content is particularly educational .  it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions .  is there a need for christ in our times ?  does love still matter ?  what for is there faith ?  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life ?  is there really someone by my side i can always trust ?  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .   second ,  the movie is exceptionally humane .  the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions .  is it better for kyle david denman )  and teri  ( megan paul )  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home ?  is it better for john  ( ken howard )  to leave ellen  ( barbara babcock )  ,  his sick wife ,  and start a new happy life with julia  ( donna bullock )  ,  a woman he falls in love with ?  in fact ,  ellen no longer recognizes him .  .  .  yet ,  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity .  had john's rebellious brother ,  phil  ( d .  david morin )  ,  better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life .  phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity .  these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where ,  when or how they live .   third ,  the movie is a great portrayal of family ,  not very popular nowadays :  there are problems ,  yet ,  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together .  this  " something "  is love and trust .  i know that it may seem a bit idealistic .  not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that .  nevertheless ,  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .   fourth ,  the entire film focuses on people's mutual help .  if we want to live happy lives in our society ,  we must understand one thing :  we have to help one another .  alexander  ( ossie davis )  is an example of such attitude .  at the beginning of the movie ,  we see him talk to john about praying .  later ,  he helps his brother .  alexander is a kinda  " angel "  that is sent to john and his family .  isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another ?   fifth ,  the artistic features are also worth attention .  performances :  barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role ,  she does a perfect job .  consider ,  for instance ,  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again .  ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband .  picture :  the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  ( autumn )  while the sunshine  ( love )  spreads everywhere .  i interpreted as a sort of symbol :  even if there is sorrow ,  this can always be illuminated by light and joy .  .  .   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love ,  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe .  at the end ,  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do   kyle to his uncle phil :  yes ,  he  ( john brighton )  lives according to the bible .  but nobody forces you to do so .  yet ,  according to what rules do you live ? 
0	i have never seen a movie as bad as this .  it is meant to be a  " fun "  movie ,  but the only joke is at the start ,  and it is not funny .  if you like this sort of movie ,  then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 .  if it had the necessary votes ,  it would truly belong on the bottom 100 .   
0	i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film ,  i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety .  was there actually a point to the film ?  ,  and the ending ,  well ,  im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film !   im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life ,  if so was it an attempt to kick start her career ?  ,  if so im afraid it must have failed .  .   i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film ,  even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world ,  if only i had had the same advice .  .  . 
1	this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on .   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .   the violence when it comes is brutal ,  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects ,  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable . 
1	this film has great acting ,  great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are ,  how you define yourself ,  how you fit in ,  whether you accept to play a role or break free .  .  .  there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects .  i want to comment on the formal setting of the film .  basically ,  it's two people on a roof .  there is unity of place and time ,  with 2 protagonists ,  and the radio acting as the choir .  many directors have turned greek tragedies into film ,  many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy ,  but no director ,  in my opinion ,  has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting .  a masterpiece . 
1	hmmm ,  yeah this episode is extremely underrated .   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts .  i think the good over wins the bad .    i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end .  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony .  it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 .    for some reason ,  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes ,  yet i have always liked them .  they're not the best ,  in terms of writing .  but the theme really does interest me ,   i'm gonna give it a three star ,  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four . 
1	this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero ,  rob roy ,  and his battles with the feudal landowners .  like braveheart to which it is frequently compared ,  it is not very historical .  despite their primarily fictional nature ,  i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two .  the 13 century william wallace is ,  as others have noted ,  a larger than life national figure ,  while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman .   the story revolves around a clan chieftain ,  robert roy mcgregor ,  who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons .  as the movie begins ,  he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle .  rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble ,  the marquis of montrose ,  in order to buy cattle to herd to market .  he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend ,  alan mcdonald .  when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing ,  rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protégé ,  archibald cunningham ,  and his sleazy factor ,  killearn .  rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival ,  the duke of argyle ,  whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite .   the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy ,  an intelligent ,  virile ,  and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale .  personally ,  i feel that this is neeson's best performance ,  his brogue  ( albeit irish )  adding authenticity for the average viewer .  rob roy is a stubborn ,  proud ,  courageous ,  and honest man whose word can be trusted .  he is a loving husband & father ,  and also touchingly loyal to his friend ,  mcdonald ,  who is accused of robbing him .    tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains ,  archibald cunningham ,  an egotistical ,  ruthless strutting peacock .  he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women ,  whether willing or otherwise .  the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity ,  though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder ,  rape ,  and thievery .  also ,  he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl ,  betty ,  after she becomes pregnant with his child ,  resulting in her suicide .  john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose ,  who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father .   the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife ,  beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary .  those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife !  i think the phrase used by this pair ,  'how fine you are to me .  .  . ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema .    the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife ,  mary mcgregor .  lacking make up ,  she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother .  the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham ,  while the disgusting killearn looks on .  her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace .  i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation ,  but nothing intended to sensationalize .  their kinsman ,  alastair mcgregor ,  shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape ,  and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham .    of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands ,  also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring .  there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart ,  but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham .  this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale . 
1	this movie is very entertaining ,  and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality .  other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy ,  the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor .  it has some pretty good special effects ,  and exciting action scenes .   as a finder of lost children ,  murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl ,  which leads him on the path for which others believe he was  " chosen "  - - to protect the golden child .  the young boy is born as an enlightened one ,  destined to save the world from evil forces ,  but whose very life is in danger ,  if not for the help of murphy ,  and his beautiful ,  mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector .   also ,  there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts .  one such scene is where the golden child ,  that murphy's character is solicited to protect ,  is tested by the monks of the mountain temple .  an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from ,  and the child is tested on his choice .   this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware .  as we accept this premise of the plot ,  we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality ,  and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away ,  and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us .   this is an excellent movie ,  with a good plot ,  fine acting ,  and for the most part ,  pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting ,  and eddie murphy humor . 
1	franco proves ,  once again ,  that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema .  true ,  much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus  ( necronomicon )  he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work .  jerry van rooyen's splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist  ( reynaud )  who may be schizophrenic ,  or may indeed  ( as one mysterious character states )  be a devil ,  attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits .  a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema . 
1	first of all ,  this movie is 34 minutes long ,  which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies .  second of all--you need to do this .  this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images .  cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant ,  a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky ,  and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning .  the scenes and images ,  extraordinary on their own ,  flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching .  furthermore ,  the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary ,  which ,  given the extremely spare dialog ,  only enhances the viewing .  the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes ,  but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of cat soup ,  along the lines of :   " well ,  the artists were asking what we should do in this scene ,  but i didn't know myself ,  so its hard to say why it turned out as it did "   ( that's a bad paraphrase by the way )  .  also ,  the sound throughout the film is very high quality ,  very precise ,  and very moody .  in all ,  the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows :   first viewing :  watch the dvd without the commentary .  second viewing :  watch the dvd with the commentary .  third viewing :  rewatch without the commentary .   once you've watched it three times ,  however ,  you're not going to stop there .  .  . 
1	one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu . story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people . the plot is in the 50 "  , when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . but , in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive . they get together after all this years on ester " s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people . 
1	another demonstration of kurosawa's genius ,  his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers ,  essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town .  swinging from comedy to tragedy and back ,  this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way ,  mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads ,  withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol .  mixing kitchen-sink realism with kabuki-esque theatrics ,  kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience ,  drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness .  a wonderful ,  draining experience . 
1	i imagine victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past ,  pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts .  along comes television :  at its best ,  it has a redemptive power ,  and with dramatisations like those the bbc produce so finely ,  victorian literature gets a new stab at life .  the religious themes ,  the moral overtones ,  may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked ,  and acquainted with cohabitation ,  affairs and domestic violence .  but those old ,  well-told stories have enduring power ,  and this is one's a hidden gem .   it's hard to gauge today just how forceful ,  feminist and extraordinary ann bronte's masterpiece ,   " the tenant of wildfell hall "  ,  actually was .  emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily ,  mental ,  societal  her heroine ,  helen huntingdon ,  escapes a miserable marriage ,  flees brutality and alcoholism ,  braves not only her abusive husband's fury ,  but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip ,  to wreak change in her life .  she pays a price ;  but retains her self-respect ;  she falls in love along the way ;  she emerges battered but victorious ,  and strong .  i just love watching women like these on screen .   the actors are superb  the best brits have to offer .  the love story is beautifully handled ,  with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors .  tara fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine ,  and as has been said here by other reviewers ,  no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle .  toby stephens ,  striking sparks off her ,  contributes just the right combination of headstrong ,  handsome youth and passionate ,  yearning vulnerability .  rupert graves  ( one of my favourite british actors ever )  enjoys himself as the charismatic villain  ( so much so that you're almost with him at the end .  no one's perfect )  .  the supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes ,  and without having felt preached to .  another bbc classic ,  highly recommended :  this is how romantic literature should be dramatised . 
0	i couldn't believe it .  i had to rub my eyes a few times .  was it true ?    yes ,  there were billy dee williams ,  jeff conaway ,  maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship !   sad as it is ,   " alien intruder "  tries to be unique ,  with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named ariel  ( scoggins )  infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain  ( williams )  .   interesting ?  maybe ,  but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of  " red shoe diaries "  .  williams out-classes everything right and left ,  and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else ,  anywhere else .  ah ,  the things people do for money .  .  .  .   the fx are pretty static ,  maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this .  unfortunately ,  even the female nudity is less than you'd expect .  sexual innuendo is the real star here and ,  of course ,  it gets all the best scenes .   if you like a movie that's all tease and no brains ,  check out  " alien intruder "  .  of course ,  you'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning .   no stars ,  not even for what star power this flick can muster .   leave this one lost in space . 
1	a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool .  it's all thrills and spills as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he's getting some serious r & r cataloguing butterflies  ( how british is that ?  )  .   trevor howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle-upon-tyne to liverpool  ( via ullswater )  - he's just been thrown out of mi5 or something ,  and she ,  you guessed it ,  is on the run ,  wrongly accused of murder .  there's seedy docks ,  rolling lake district hills ,  sheep ,  country pubs ,  coppers getting lost ,  waterfalls ,  a bunch of amateur cyclists ,  rooftop chases ,  and lots of chinamen  ( don't ask )  ,  and it's all very hitchcocky and hannayesque .  .  .    .  . and a smashing example of british noir .  .  . 
1	this ,  and  " hidden fortress "  are the kurosawa's that are most dear to me .  i don't hand out 10's like candy ,  but this certainly deserved it ,  if anything .  even though it's quite long  ( like all kurosawa's pretty much are )  it concurred the problem which bugs me with most of his films ;  the storyline is often too loose and slowly evolving ,  containing scenes that are unnecessary or just lenghtened too much without any real purpose to the storyline or the character description .  dodesukaden delivered to me the same experience that for example  " hidden fortress "  did ;  despite its lenght ,  there wasn't a single minute i would cut out .   this is also a very unusual kurosawa film in a way ,  it has no storyline ,  but many little independent stories which are based more to the character description than storyline ,  unlike any other kurosawa-film i have seen so far .  it also leans much on the dialogue ,  which he uses brilliantly  ( especially in the story between the father and the son planning their  " new house "  )  .    still the thing that makes this one a masterpiece is how the subject being so tragic as it is ,  is managed to be described so humanely and sympathetically ,  without pointing fingers at anybody at any point .  from the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance . 
1	after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century ,  in 1908 playwright d . w .  griffith got the job that would make him a legend :  he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies .  it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business ,  but he accepted the job ,  and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative .  many years later ,  he would direct  " the birth of a nation "  in 1915 ,  the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors ;  however ,  a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career .  1909's  " the sealed room "  is one of those ,  and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century .    " the sealed room "  is a story set in the 16th century in which a count  ( arhtur v .  johnson )  has built a windowless room in his castle .  it is a small yet nice and very cozy room ,  as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife ,  the countess  ( marion leonard )  in a more private way .  however ,  the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful ,  as she is infatuated with the minstrel  ( henry b .  walthall )  at court ,  with whom she is having an affair .  as soon as the count gets busy with his own business ,  the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room .  when the count returns ,  he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect ,  finally discovering the two lovers in his room ;  but instead of making a scene ,  he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife :  to seal the windowless room with the couple inside .   written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e .  woods ,   " the sealed room "  takes elements from edgar allan poe's  " the cask of amontillado "  and mainly honoré de balzac's  " la grande breteche "  to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism .  despite having a runtime of 11 minutes ,  woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way ,  and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story .  while a melodrama at heart ,  woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era .   " the sealed room "  is definitely a very simple and basic story ,  but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas .   in  " the sealed room "  ,  griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual .  while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience ,  in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror ,  playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had .  it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot ,  culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes .  not being a movie where camera tricks are essential ,  what shines the most in  " the sealed room "  is griffith's talent to direct his actors ,  as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day .   as usual ,  the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith ,  starting with arthur v .  johnson as the count .  johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster .  his performance is not without a touch of overacting ,  but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality .  as the countess ,  marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting ,  conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery .  finally ,  the legendary henry b .  walthall appears as the handsome minstrel ,  and while far from being one of his best performances ,  he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film .  while not of real importance to the plot ,  it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background ,  like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court .   while not exactly a masterpiece ,   " the sealed room "  is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days .  the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget ,  griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style .  the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era ,  and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch .  while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential  ( and controversial )   " the birth of a nation "  ,  the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend .  simple yet elegant ,   " the sealed room "  is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century .  7/10
1	petter mattei's  " love in the time of money "  is a visually stunning film to watch .  mr .  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations .  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money ,  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter .    this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme ,  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect .  each one is connected in one way ,  or another to the next person ,  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact .  stylishly ,  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look .  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat .   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits .  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment ,  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter .   the acting is good under mr .  mattei's direction .  steve buscemi ,  rosario dawson ,  carol kane ,  michael imperioli ,  adrian grenier ,  and the rest of the talented cast ,  make these characters come alive .   we wish mr .  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work . 
1	an absolutely brilliant show .  the second season began where the first ended ,  with much mystery .  suspense in most ,  if not all episodes and mystery everywhere .  one that made me think and think again .  it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful .  never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season .  hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time ,  more mystery to be solved .  good selection of cast too for this show ,  fit the characters perfectly .  really can't wait to finally discover the secret .  hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending . 
1	 " a mouse in the house "  is a very classic cartoon by tom & jerry ,  faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own .  it is hysterical ,  hilarious ,  very entertaining and quite amusing .  artwork is of good quality either .   this short isn't just about tom trying to catch jerry .  butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too ,  because «there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse» .   if you ask me ,  there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon .  the funniest for me are ,  for example ,  when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically «i'm glad you're enjoying the siesta» and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't ,  making the two cats gasp .  another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom .  of course that ,  even funnier than this ,  is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both  ( dumb !  )  cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the  " rear "  - lol .  naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad ,  she isn't someone to mess with .  but even jerry doesn't win this time ,  because he is expelled by her too . 
1	i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old .  unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night .  now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it .   this is really not an ordinary horror movie .  it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy .  i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes .  especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short .   now to the plot .  this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill .  while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse .  when she fells a sleep ,  which often strangely happens just immediately ,  she finds herself near the house on a big green field .  she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams .  one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to .  as she forgets to draw his legs  ( because he is sitting behind a window )  the boy cannot walk .  later she is being told by the doctor ,  that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn ,  she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams .  she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams .  as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house .  she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting .  she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn .  and next time she falls asleep the horror begins .  her father is mad and blind  ( because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid' )  and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend .  her dreams became a horrendous nightmare .  they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up .  than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed .  the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so .  they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings .  anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to .  she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy  ( i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page )  and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever .   there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie .  first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike .  i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short .  how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead ?  why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ?  i hated that scene it was so dumb to me .  it almost ruined the main horror scene .   things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene .  i liked the boy .  the actor was awesome .  he was even better than anna .  i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage .   overall a good movie .  i give it a 8 out of 10 . 
1	in the ten years since wildside aired ,  nothing has really come close to its quality in local production .  this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated underbelly ,  which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne .  the miniseries blue murder  ( which also starred tony martin ,  but as someone on the other side of the law )  may be the exception .   wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the abc .  having not watched the show in quite a while ,  i'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters .  the cast is excellent :  tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son ,  rachael blake  ( who later hooked up with martin in real life )  as a community worker struggling with alcoholism ,  and alex dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling .  equally good support roles are provided by aaron pederson ,  jessica napier ,  mary coustas  ( yes ,  effie herself )  ,  and a young abbie cornish .   the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago .  the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me ,  but i'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers .   a great series which has aged remarkably well .  here's hoping the abc's dvd department gets its act together .    ( according to a moderator on an abc message board ,  some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009 ) 
1	this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant .  in order to get the two together ,  einstien agrees to help ed ( hudsucker proxy's tim robbins )  learn to act more intelligent .  this impresses catherine  ( meg ryan )  .  unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius .  hilarity ensues .  not to be missed .  filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university ,  lawrenceville prep school  ( doubling for princeton university )  as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell . 
0	while watching this movie i got sick .  i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure .  when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh .  but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again .  it is terrible from beginning to it's end .  how can they manage to make it soo bad .  well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .  .  but they are never close to pippi .  may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast .  burn the movie and save the kids .  if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh .  we love pippi inger nilsson ,  sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi .  .  oh yes .  .  when read the  " spoilers "  explanation ,   " 'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film .  "  well i guess the director stands for this .  .  .  you are looking at this movie at your own risk .  .  it is really a waste of time .  .  . 
1	it's a colorful slasher movie .  that's about it .   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies ,  but i never care for such things .  figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway .   the death scenes were inventive and gorey ,  bringing back memories of 80's horror movies like friday the 13th .    another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl ,  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious .    people who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie .  as simple as that .  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same .    --mb
1	this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue .  what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga .  the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for .  there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection ,  'comics underground japan' ,  and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here .  i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this ,  as it explains some of the  " plot "  of the movie ,  which is otherwise inexplicable .  animation wise this is pretty decent ,  good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well .  it jumps in and out of episodes ,  as the characters ,  a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images :  a boat ,  a circus ,  a desert .  for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings ,  which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random ,  but primarilly selected visually .  knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation .  this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show ,  cartoon sushi ,  in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt-cheek around the house .  only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell what's going on] .  the dvd of this has director's commentary and a  " making of "  features ,  but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them .  i'm giving this a 8/10 for now ,  here isnt much to compare it to in anime ,  and i hope for more like this . 
0	now ,  i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it .  he is an excellent actor ,  brilliant in everything .  .  . except this movie .  and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was ,  and didn't bother with a good performance .  this movie is a unintentional-comedy .  some of the lines just crack me up .  and them there are some lines that make no sense ,  and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot .  oh !  btw the plot is bad !  but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch .  i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans ,  or fans of any of the other actors ,  because the plot is pathetic . 
1	i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie .  i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me .  before i start my review ,  let me first say this .  .  . it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner ,  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .   plot :   simply stated ,  it's not boring .  most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people ,  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit .  this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while .  just for reference ,  i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent ,  and i enjoyed them both tremendously ,  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told .  they don't take any chances whatsoever ,  and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films .  domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking ,   " oh man ,  they're screwed now "  .  and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films .  it has a lot of depth to it ,  in my opinion ,  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it .  overall ,  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .   characters :   i felt that the characters were accurate .  knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman ,  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was .  it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .   choco was also very believable ,  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations ,  his reactions to domino's lack of affection ,  as well as his jealousy issues within the team .  .  . they all rang true to me ,  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .   rourke's character was the least interesting to me ,  but it still rang true to me .  he seemed like an ordinary guy ,  trying to make ends meet .  i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it .  he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes ,  yet is still trying to live .   claremont/ladies :  i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story .  they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley ,  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal .  you could empathize with them because ,  to them ,  this child's illness was a problem with no other solution .  these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .   the mobsters :  they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can .  and i really liked that part .  they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .   christopher walken/90210 guys :   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie .  from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens .  their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .   cinematography .  .  .  . yes .  .  .  . the cinematography .  this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans .  but in my opinion i thought it was genius ,  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion .  i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement ,  just like anything else .  i both applaud and congratulate scott ,  the editor ,  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie .  not only did they go far and above with its presentation ,  they went that much further .  the use of colors ,  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob ,  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else .  if you notice ,  in times of less stress or conflict ,  there were very few camera tricks if any at all .  this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it .  i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach .  hollywood films have grown predictable and bland .  most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns .  and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different .   granted ,  this movie isn't for everyone ,  but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point .  i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it .  i would recommend this to all ,  but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few .  i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie ,  but i think many people will .  we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co .  took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique .  and with that in mind ,  i think he succeeded tremendously . 
1	this film plays really well with an audience .  especially once the chase begins .  plus ,  trevor howard with his sensible ,  smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together .   the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border .  some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household ,  plus it helps bring out the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job .  the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away .  and it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge .  the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth .   this is an entertaining film .  seek it out if you can find it . 
0	if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners ,  i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone .   the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion ,  which takes place in a supposed abandon high school ( looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick )  ,  and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on .  this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge .   john hughes falls in love with his characters too much ,  as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady ( goonies' anne ramsey )  .  we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed ,  but never see a blasted thing !  this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s . 
1	this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor .  i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor ,  i just don't think she did a very good job .  bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie .  they are going by train to davis's relatives house .  davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest .  but when they arrive home ,  their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it .  it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas .  their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself . 
0	what can i say ?  ?  ?  this movie was so dumb & stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy - they should rename it  " bitching pregnant cat fight !  "  what a stupid waste of time  ,  if you want to see ( die die !  !  !   " i want your baby drag queen )  jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the  " chucky "  movie ,  oh ya  ,   " the bride of chucky .  "  it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls  ( one of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky )  having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant  ,  dumb & stupid ;  & jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work !  ok it's just bad !  !  ! 
0	ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours .  when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left .  but ,  ever hopeful ,  i stayed .  and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time .  acting was ok ,  but the story line is so transparent and weak .  the script is about as lame as it could get ,  but again ,  stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue . 
1	story of ireland in the 70/s .  this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970/s .  all the gang are there see below .  master boyle  ,  the boys  ,  the cannon  ,  sp o'donnell  ,  senator doogan's daugter  ,  rose  ,  agnes  ,  maura and una .  see this film . feel ireland as it was .   
0	and rent a good horror movie .  it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  " scream "  and  " scary movie "  .   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written .  stupid  " we're going to the prom "  junk .  i wanted to claw my ears off .  honestly ,   " the hills "  has better dialog .   there really was no need to make this movie .  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  " her ?  really ?  guy is obsessed with her ?  really ?  "    all the characters act in stupid ways ,  including the police .   ( cover the place in teams of 2 !  front and back !  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed .  )    the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem .  no resistance from victims  ( or doors )  .  nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  ( or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door )  .  the people are like mentally disabled sheep .   by the by ,  if you're a gore fan ,  you'll be disappointed too .  all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done .   ( so boo hoo for you !  )    none of the killings is the least bit interesting .  most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out .   the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies .   " oh kitty !  you scared me !  i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee !  "    and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well ,  let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice .  snore .   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout .  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough .  don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making .    ( oh ,  and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen .  no tiara .  no bucket of blood .  )    so save your money and rent  " carrie "  or  " friday the 13th "  or  " halloween "  or  " scream "  or  " scary movie "   ( any of them )  to get a good scare with some original twists . 
1	parker and stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results .  much of the film is trey and matt running amok with their new toy box .  the plot is simplicity itself :  two average guys invent a new sport ,  a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze .  along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up ,  along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights .  it runs like a stretched south park episode ,  with the usual machine-gun dialogue ,  toilet humour and homilies from the heart .   if this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us  " airplane "  and the  " naked gun "  series .  this influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional yasmine bleeth in the role usually given to priscilla presley .  robert vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since  " bullitt "  and ernest borgnine overacts as only he can ,  but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner .   for those who haven't noticed yet ,  parker and stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics .  this manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create .  as usual ,  they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-pc vehicle dvda .   a special mention must go to dian bachar ,  who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing stan to parker and stone's rampaging pair of cartmans .   in summary ,  this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the  " naked gun/airplane "  formula .  parker and stone could do something truly brilliant  ( or absolutely awful )  if given full control over a future film .  america ,  either lock these guys up or put them in charge . 
1	this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars .  it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to .  plus the bomb blast scene is very real .   what you read and are taught just does not happen !  !  !   can raise your bp level by 10%  all actors played their role very well .   some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers .   this movie is quite adult in nature .   not a movie that can be seen with family .   casting is great !  !  ! 
1	i only wish that return of the jedi ,  have been directed by somebody else ,  i mean ,  there is far too much ewoks scenes ,  completely unnecessary .  besides this time our heroes look like different people :  princess leia no longer fights with solo ,  luke looks boring ,  darth vader is not as evil as before ,  and yoda just dies .   but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it .   some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence .  3-the emperor  ( now that's evil )  4- the speeders chase at the endor forest .  5-the last battle .  6-the dark side seduction scene .  7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force .  8- and the last celebration .   some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes .  if some scenes would have been cut ,  and another director was hired ,  this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,  but still is extraordinary .  9 out of 10 . 
1	though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors ,  special effects that are excellent ,  and a story line that is full of surprises ,  it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd .  perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information ,  or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut ,  but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity ,  fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it .   the theme is old :  rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the f . r . a . t .   ( first response assault and tactical )  team ,  a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime ,  drugs ,  prostitution etc .  working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now ,  15 years after its formation ,  frat is responsible for murder ,  drug trafficking ,  terrorizing innocent people etc .  the lead dog is lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott ,  who makes a terrifyingly real gangster !  )  and his partner rafe deed  ( ll cool j ,  even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor )  .  reporter pollack  ( justin timberlake )  catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss ashford  ( the always reliably fine morgan freeman )  .  gradually polack convinces ashford and subsequently wallace  ( kevin spacey ,  also a consistently fine character actor )  and they aid pollack in this investigative reporting .  the closer pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results .   timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead ,  especially in the company of such seasoned actors .  but ll cool j ,  freeman ,  spacey ,  and mcdermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end .  no ,  it is not a great movie ,  but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message .  grady harp
1	how can anyone not love this movie  ?  i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies ;  if you've never seen them ,  watch this instead .  michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes .  one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d . a .  ,  but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo .  he has all the best lines .  danny devito ,  alan hale ,  ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than  " mafia "  did for the criminal underground . 
1	the shining starts with jack torrance  ( jack nicholson )  driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager stuart ullman  ( barry nelson )  about becoming the winter caretaker .  ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in .  together with his wife wendy  ( shelley duvall )  & young son danny  ( danny lloyd )  jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine ,  it's a beautiful hotel ,  absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal .  however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't .  as the days ,  weeks & months begin to pass jack become more & more insane ,  danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family ,  as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it .  .  .   this english production was co-written ,  co-produced & directed by stanley kubrick & is a fine horror film .  it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length .  the script by kubrick & diane johnson ,  is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i can't compare them ,  goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film .  there are very few character's in the shining with jack ,  wendy & danny the only ones that really matter ,  since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them ,  become involved with them & what they go through .  the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout .  on the negative side i don't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me ,  the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & i don't know if i missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever ,  i'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about !  there is very little in the way of violence or gore ,  a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story .  with a budget of about $19 , 000 , 000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick ,  the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors ,  the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners ,  basements & cobwebs kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors ,  massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor  ( well 80's modern ,  just check that red toilet out !  )  .  the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start .  the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i'm not sure i'd watch it again anytime soon .  for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed ,  for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you ,  well worth a watch in my humble opinion . 
1	this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool ,  and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle' .  the film stands the test of time quite well ,  with all the moral stories still  ( or even more )  relevant today .  the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum ,  stanley baker ,  peter cushing and anne heywood .  baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties ,  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age ,  they will end up being responsible adults .   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  ( fred fowell )  and melvyn hayes  ( gloria )  .  tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  ( they are real life brother and sister )  who are caught up in an arsonists web .  tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor' .   violent playground features a gun siege in a school ,  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland / russia .   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  ( though was not born at the time )  ,  and have fond memories of the area .  i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground' ,  and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite .  the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released ,  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light .  time has helped heal those wounds .   a little gem of a film ,  i would recommend you seek this out
1	an excellent example of  " cowboy noir "  ,  as it's been called ,  in which unemployed michael  ( nicolas cage )  loses out on a job because he insists on being honest  ( he's got a bum leg )  .  with really nothing else he can do ,  he decides that for once he's going to lie .  when he walks into a bar ,  and the owner wayne  ( the late ,  great j . t .  walsh )  mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle in fine form )  ,  michael plays along and accepts waynes' money .  *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions ,  and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne !  if that didn't complicate things enough ,  the real hit-man ,   " lyle from dallas "   ( dennis hopper ,  in a perfect role for him )  shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before .    " red rock west "  gets a lot out of the locations .  director john dahl ,  who co-wrote the script with his brother rick ,  was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes .  it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation .  it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt ,  have at least been morally compromised like michael .  the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ;  even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing .  even if the writing isn't particularly  " logical or credible "  ,  the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in .   cage does a good job in the lead ,  but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters .  hopper ,  boyle ,  and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts .  timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies  ( in one especially good twist ,  walsh is also the local sheriff )  ,  and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam ,  who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune .   it's quite a good little film worth checking out .  it moves forward at an impressive pace ,  and if nothing else is certainly never boring .   8/10
0	good performances can't save this terrible script ,  larded with every cliche in the chick-flick book .  both main characters are deeply unsympathetic ,  and the scene where laura linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son -- which i think is supposed to be poignant -- is just horrifying . 
1	an unassuming ,  subtle and lean film ,   " the man in the white suit "  is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios .  while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure ,  i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot ,  the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course .   the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired  " kind hearts and coronets "  from 1949 .  this time ,  he merely plays one character rather than eight ,  but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton ,  he always finds the correct tone and expression .  along with guinness' subtle ,  expressive performance ,  the rest of the cast are effective .  of the main players ,  cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out .  thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee ,  while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father .  father ,  that is ,  of joan greenwood ,  the deftly delectable comic actress ,  who is at her insurmountable peak in this film .  resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction ,  she is quite sublime in this film ,  a fine contrast with the similarly unusual ,  but more maladroit guinness .  the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing .  .  .   the themes are handled very effectively ,  with no easy morals drawn .  the complexities of the relationships between science ,  business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined .  expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick ,  this film is technically adept in all areas ;  evocative photography ,  fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script ,  all quietly impress .  a thoroughly satisfying film ,  with guinness and greenwood magnificent .   rating : - **** 1/2/*****
0	this movie will promote the improvement of the mind .  read a book !  it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make .  i've seen  " b "  movies before but the  " c "  movie has just been invented .  i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into  " knights .  "  high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume .  embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind .  my roommate ,  who loves these types of movies even turned it off .  now that has to really tell you something .  if you watch this movie ,  and like it ,  i will pray for you . 
0	i cannot believe that they managed to spend us$17million on this film .  spectacularly bad acting ,  egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc ,  unbelievable plot contrivances .  .  . a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un ?  what ?  not only that ,  but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix .  all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money .  if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe ,  they would have used the money to help people truly in need .  now ,  /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them . 
1	a great film this ,  and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four .   the plot is a simple one but works very effectively ,  the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred .  the budget looks pretty low ,  but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often .  it also hasn't dated that much either .   i was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago ,  and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings .  it's one of those films that won't appeal to all ;  though as usual ,  those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this .   charlotte buerke puts in a good performance as anna ,  the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene .  cross is also very good ,  carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture .   there are some genuinely  ( and i don't say that lightly )  disturbing moments in this film ,  both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions .  watch it with the lights out !   highly recommended .   9/10  
0	don't get me wrong  ,  i want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy .  i shall digress now .  the writing ,  though ,  was unrealistic .  a pta mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person .  give me a break .  the smugness of very pretty mary louise parkers character was an insult to my intelligence .  the characters were not at all likable .  basically ,  the plot lines went nowhere .  i understand its only tv land  .  the hypocrisy was blatant .  mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this .  .  .  .  why  ?  ?  ?  ?  i just got the feeling i was being preached by a show reeking of seediness .  its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife  ,  but with someone of legal age status .  ok not exactly the same thing  ,  but i think you people get my point .  that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails  ,  i guess ,  but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom  ,  as the local pot dealer . 
0	over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids ,  i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy ,  direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through  ( for anyone over the age of eight )  .  i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me  " what did she say that for ?  "  and  " why did he do that ?  "  and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes .  and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply  " bringing realism "  to a film ,  please run them through with a dull butter knife .   " prehysteria !  "  was head and shoulders above this .  arrgh . 
1	this is my favorite classic .  it was filmed a little west of philadelphia ,  pa when i was 13 ,  in 1957 ,  and released the next year .  then in 1970 ,  i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper .  i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed .  i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well ,  and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  " home of the blob "  .  the theater scene was in phoenixville ,  near valley forge park and it is still showing films today ! 
0	i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son .  he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did .  the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion .  in fact ,  i had a very hard time paying attention at all .  the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out .   not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept ,  it's just told so oddly ,   ( bad screenplay ?  )  especially when we  " meet the family "  for the first time .  i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord ,  they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes  ( seemingly ,  i didn't actually time it )  .  by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit . 
0	although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching ,  you better skip this one .  i watched this one on television ,  so i didn't have to plunk down cash for it .  lucky me .   the plot develops slowly ,  very slowly .  although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable ,  it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end .  it is highly questionable ,  if a seasoned soldier like lt .  waters would disobey direct orders .  and even if he would ,  if the rest of his platoon would .  they know he puts them in direct danger ,  and they know they will certainly die if they follow him ,  but what the heck ,  he is our lt .  so let's do what he says  ( despite the direct orders ,  remember )  .   still ,  there are some nice scenes in this movie .  they somewhat save a village ,  where the total population is being massacred by the rebels .  well ,  they save a dozen villagers or so ,  the rest was already killed .  the strange part of it ,  that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind .  they rather go on foot .  maybe because the roads are unsafe ,  but there was no explanation for it .  anyway .  i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it .   what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves .  only near the end they loose a few comrades .  and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more .  can you believe that ?   they fight of an army of so many ,  kill hundreds of them ,  and only loose a few of themselves .  and they have rounds and round of ammo .  never run out of it .  grenades and claymore mines ,  an m60 machine gun and even an rpg .  where do they get this stuff .  carrying it around or what ?  they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels .  and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days .  really ?  who think up this crap .   i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots ,  you give this movie a high rating .  if not ,  skip this one .  it saves you time . 
0	maddy  ( debbie rochon )  is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker .  when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `murder club , ' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage  ( for denting her car !  )  .  but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it ?   the plot of this film  ( originally titled make 'em bleed )  is very poorly conceived ,  full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous ,  out-of-left-field twist ending .  some of the dialogue is downright laughable .  i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance ,  but the supporting cast was atrocious .  however ,  i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained .  there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart .  horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman  ( as debbie's parents )  and julie strain  ( an early victim )  .   score :  4 out of 10
0	this show had pretty good stories ,  but bad dialog .  the main character was especially annoying .  it's quite obvious why this show was canceled ,  although ,  like most upn shows ,  i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs .   most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies ,  leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads .    i haven't commented enough .  you've got to have at least ten lines of text .  the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show .   the gnome was a nice character . 
0	i don't even know where to begin on this one .   " it's all about the family .  "  that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a  " horror "  movie ,  although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried !  !  !  ugh !  !  !  and i know that owen wilson is a better actor .  he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie  ( anaconda ,  armageddon )  .  after all ,  the man did co-write  " bottle rocket "  and  " rushmore .  "  he does have some talent .  also ,  lily taylor should stick to indie films .  she has no place here .  finally ,  catherine zeta-jones should become a porn star .  there's no room in legitimate acting for her .  i'm serious .  one of the worst movies i've ever seen ,  ever . 
1	this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts ,  i love the final ,  when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life ,  but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right ,  is jut for two ,  so what are the other persons doing there ?  the movie embrace you to a new life ,  to experiences ,  to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams .  also shows you the life itself ,  hard like it is .  but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need .  hope this comment works for you .  the movie it did worked well for me .  i bought the movie by the way  ;  )  take care . 
0	i tried twice to get through this film ,  succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer .  the problem ?  it's simply too boring .   if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene ,  which takes up most of the second half of the film ,  you have it made ,  but it's tough getting to that point .  there are some interesting talks by  " abraham lincoln "   ( henry fonda )  during the trial .  the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they superimpose his memoral statue over the screen .   it's a nice story ,  well-acted and such .  .  .  . but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there .  i suspect the real abe lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film . 
1	the fourth in the  " dirty harry "  series ,  this film features one of the most despicable ,  ugliest ,  unlikable ,  profane ,  disgusting females i have ever seen on film :   " ray perkins ,  "  played by audrie neenan .  she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945  " detour "  character ,   " ann savage .  "   her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up .  .  .  . and least some of her !  then i could enjoy the rest of the movie .   everywhere  " harry callahan "   ( clint eastwood )  goes ,  violence immediately follows .  .  .  .  . within minutes !  it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving ,  entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one .   this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts .  .  .  .  . and connects ,  sad to say .  most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end ,  and who does it better than dirty harry ? 
1	anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked .  it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer ,  but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time .  one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor ,  bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again .  notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending ,  which is highly  " emotional "  .  keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ,  ted theodore logan in bill and ted :  the return . 
0	put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle :  a thrash-metal updating of  " dracula "  ,  with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker  ( who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway )  and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore .  christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing ;  he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse ,  which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans .  this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century !  the film ,  well-produced but without a single original idea  ( except for multi-racial victims )  ,  is both repulsive and lazy ,  and after about an hour starts repeating itself .  * from ****
0	yes ,  mtv there really is a way to market daria .  what started as a clever teenage angst- " comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life "  sitcom now mutated into a  " how you should deal with your problems " -charade .  i used to watch daria all the time and loved it .  now ,  sitting here after watching the so called  " movie "  i can only wonder what the point of this all was .  daria tells us how to lead out life in college ?  excuse me ?  didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok ,  as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ?  this entire thing reminded me of the scene in  " reality bites "  the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time . 
0	usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens .  .  . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through .  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically .  corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual ,  nicole eggert was not much better .  this has no redeeming qualities ,  even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away ! 
0	waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand ,  i expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology ,  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it ,  once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot ,  which by my opinion was the worse in this year .  acting in this movie also dissatisfied me ,  will smith didn't show anything new in this movie ,  yet i never saw his acting to change since  " men in black "  which was his only success by my opinion .  he had to retire since than ,  not spoiling his name with titles like  " i , robot "  and  " men in black 2 "  .  4/10
0	john rivers' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car .  during the days she has been missing ,  he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through e . v . p - electronic voice phenomenon .  naturally he doesn't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e . v . p .  soon enough john is hooked onto it ,  but something supernatural doesn't like him interfering with the dead ,  as now other then contacting his wife ,  the white noise is foretelling events before they happen .   since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now ,  i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy .  but then again i don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back ,  as they haven't question me about it .  oh well .  so i decided to give it a play ,  as i was in an undemanding mood .  after hearing and reading all the bad press on it ,  i wasn't expecting anything remotely good ,  but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes .  well ,  more so the 60 minutes ,  as the last half-an-hour was pretty much a blur of confusion .  the film is nowhere as good as it could have been ,  but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller .  i thought it wasn't all a waste .  the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you ,  but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film .  that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context .  it becomes rather hectic ,  loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera-work that gets to close into the action .  i couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax .  the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey .  it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big ,  but hits rock bottom .  i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera-work .  other then the distinctively stark lighting ,  the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy .  all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware ,  which makes it come across as very sterile and empty .   you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story .  there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material .  after a while ,  it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave .  it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while .  the e . v . p machine was the star on the show .  well ,  it did have more impact than the limp performances .  michael keaton is more than capable actor ,  but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers .  he really deserves much better ,  though .  everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable .  not because of the performances ,  but of the lack of depth in their characters .  this clunker wasn't bad to begin with ,  but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically .   i wouldn't care to see it again and i wouldn't recommend to anyone ,  unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror/thrillers .  it's just a damn shame that this over-produced flick couldn't put it together successfully ,  as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand .  i didn't hate it ,  but what a disappointment . 
0	this movie is similar to darkness falls , and the boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either . it's also slow and fairly predictable . it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon . really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that , there is some really awful clichéd dialogue . and i won't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean . there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake . it just wasn't necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy : 4/10
0	this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie .  the story is wrong and a complete lie .  there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy .  it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry .  the marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism .  unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ,  ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him ,  thus the end of the soviet union and its' cohorts .   never ,  ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding sen .  mccarthy .  read ann coulter's book ,   " treason "  for a better look at the truth about sen .  mccarthy .   it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http : //www . thenewamerican . com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy . htm
0	bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful .  to this end ,  he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies .  i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies .  i don't remember it ever being fully explained .  all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife .   ( i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid .  spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s .  )  you can pretty much guess the rest from here .   there are a couple  ( well ,  really more than a couple ,  but i'll only write about two )  of problems that i have with this movie .  one is the way bela is used .  sure ,  he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way  ( btw ,  the rest of the cast is simply abysmal )  .  but ,  to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly .  also ,  why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has ?  is it to make him look evil ?  well ,  someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil .   the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides .  why brides ?  wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do ?  watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims ,  i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer .  in each case ,  there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control .   ( btw ,  an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides .  i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides' .  ) 
1	i am currently on vacation in israel for summer ,  and so was able to see this incredible film .  a bit of a warning before i begin writing :  i speak fluent hebrew ,  and so the hebrew parts were no problem ;  however ,  about a quarter  ( a bit less )  of the film is in arabic ,  and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit .  this did not detract from my understanding of the film ,  but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater .   after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships ,  it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest ;  yet ,   " the bubble "  surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting ,  witty dialogue ,  and relevant political climate .   the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli-palestinian border ;  for the first few moments ,  we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on .  yet ,  this is an important element of this film's strength .  the political situation ,  and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background .  most importantly ,  tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film .  it is constantly referenced .  street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged .  the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly ,  and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam  ( ohad knoller )  and a palestinian immigrant ,  ashraf ( yousef 'joe' sweid )  ,  with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil .  we always know that their relationship is forbidden ,  and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema .  the love is incredibly strong ,  and stands as the centerpiece of the film .  the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong :  flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's  (  yousef 'joe' sweid )  relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider ,  golan  ( zohar liba )  ,  is particularly a source of amusement .  the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite ,  fine crafted works of art ,  and the cinematography is astounding :  in the first love scene of the film ,  the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu  ( daniela virtzer )  ,  and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf .  this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love .   to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy ,  but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate ,  so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue .  even when watching this movie in my second language ,  i could not stop laughing throughout .  lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven ,  and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber .  this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema .  the music used in the film is also particularly powerful .  music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it ,  and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other .  little elements like this truly elevate the film .   i could not give greater recommendation to a film ;  this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted . 
1	i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it .  this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards .  parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi .  jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach .  jazz  ( parminder nagra )  loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married .  when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet  ( kiera knightlety )  and joe  ( jonathon rhyes meyers )  who is her coach .  when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky  ( archie punjabi's )  wedding .  at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play . 
0	this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen .  to begin ,  i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading ,  if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown ,  you are soooo wrong .  in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover ,  it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool .  speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool ,  there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods ,  then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight .  .  .  i mean seriously wtf ?  ?  ?  how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through ?  i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining ,  if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right ?  wrong !  the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s . i . c . k  bottom line is :  don't see this film !  !  ! 
1	i thought it was an original story ,  very nicely told .  i think all you people are expecting too much .  i mean .  .  . it's just a made for television movie !  what are you expecting ?  some great wonderful dramtic piece ?  i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .  .  .  . and that's my opinion . 
1	sunday july 16 ,  8 : 00pm the castro ,  san francisco   " as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana "   the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years .  that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving ,  is often speculated .  considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into ,  this criticism would seem to have some validity .  as a comedienne however ,  her star shone very brightly .  left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand .  one of her better outings was king vidor's show people  ( 1928 )  ,  which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos .  this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars ,  davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker ,  william haines .  rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson ,  who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama  ( and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone !  )  with von stroheim ,  walsh and demille .  coincidentally ,  the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before  ( think of who worked there !  )  .   colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper  ( dell henderson )  drives his daughter peggy  ( davies )  from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies .  these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone  ( haines )  ,   "   a custard pie artist  "  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance  ( watch for the bit with the noodle )  ,  and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture .  what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball ,  but a job is a job and billy convinces her  "   .   .  all the stars have to take it on the chin   "  .  at the preview ,  billy and peggy bump into  .  .  charlie chaplin ,  who asks for her autograph !  she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign .  chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed ,  so naturally ,  she faints .  it's so very funny ,  considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy !  peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios ,  changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind .  davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress ,  with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips .  vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot  ( and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder ,  facing the camera !  )  that includes polly moran  ( who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid )  ,  louella parsons  ( one of the friendly vampires )  ,  estelle taylor ,  claire windsor aileen pringle ,  the comedy duo of karl dane  ( with his arm in a sling )  and george k .  arthur  ( pretending he's stealing the silverware )  ,  leatrice joy  ( amused by arthur's antics )  ,  renee adoree ,  rod  ( eating and smoking )  la rocque ,  mae murray ,  john  ( in a robe )  gilbert  ( who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture )  ,  norma  ( eeeww !  )  talmadge  ( looking bitchy and aloof as usual )  and patricia dressed like marie antoinette ,  sandwiched between douglas fairbanks  ( as he does an amusing trick )  and william s .  hart  ( protecting her from doug )  .  billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming ,  with predictably nutty results .  vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production .  also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick ,  sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does ,  and paul ralli as andre ,  her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony .  when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it .   while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence ,  it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm ,  irving thalberg ,  and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent .  what a shame so much has been lost .  there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy  ( 1928 )  ,  vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year ,  languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed . 
1	stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum ,  the great walter brennan to accomplish that ,  they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson ,  in canadian territory ,  where they sell them .  .  .   along the way they meet the man who runs the gold-crazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire .  .  .  he attempts to steal them the herd .  .  .  later ,  in dawson ,  mcintire and his gang reappear ,  this time interfering with stewart's gold claim .  .  .    captured by mann's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies ,  stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claims  in this entertaining ,  beautiful western ,  stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with :  ruth roman ,  a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile ,  the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment .  .  .  in spontaneous manner ,  stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife-candidate .  .  . 
0	poor performances by sinatra ,  martin and hyer .  grossly underdeveloped supporting characters .  annoying talky with no real plot .  ending leaves you flatter than a pancake ,  with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels  ( that is ,  if you even cared about these wooden characters )  .  maclaine is the only real asset .  that penultimate sequence in which the  " chicago hood "  searches for the sinatra character is laughable .  the music in that sequence also is poor .  and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a  " pig ,  "  almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen . 
0	it's interesting that all who  ( so far )  seemed to like this film had no expectations--i guess that's the trick .  in contrast with them ,  i had optimistic expectations ,  and that was a mistake .  as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was ,  i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them ,  they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors .  the actors in this film ,  though ,  had only one facial expression each .    if the close camera wasn't enough ,  the lack of light in the film killed it .  the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark .  so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur ,  as well .   " ooh ooh ,  we're going to light the set with a flashlight !  that will make it all seem intimate !  "  no ,  that made it all seem invisible .   on top of the serious technical flaws ,  there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed ,  and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated .   ( perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany ,  but in los angeles ,  forget about it .  )   the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film ,  but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals .  i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it .  in fact ,  two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave  ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's  " total darkness "  technique )  .  but when the film shuddered on ,  instead ,  there were moans coming from the audience .  and once the movie finally did end ,  it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points .  an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity  ( folding sheets ,  cutting vegetables ,  spreading honey on bread )  .  yeah ,  we get it ,  the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning .   i recommend that audiences miss this one ,  it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers . 
0	if this movie were more about piper perabo's character and less about the bar ,  this might have been halfway decent .  piper's violet stanford and karen friendly  ( adventures of rocky and bullwinkle )  both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing .  here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in . 
0	pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy .  the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong .   examples ?  quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion .  how ?  well ,  in the world of the subatomic ,  you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time .  you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time .  also ,  the act of observation seems to affect the event .  solid particles can pass through barriers .  all of this ,  so far ,  is accurate .  but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall ,  you could indeed do it .  this is complete poppycock .  instead ,  the theory asserts that at our level ,  it is possible for you to walk through a wall ,  but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief .  also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall ,  the odds are so astronomically against it .   this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science .  but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer ,  played by marlee maitlan .  about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible .  something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate .  there may be some truth to that ,  but quantum physics has nothing to do with it .   plus ,  string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays .  instead of wasting your time with this dreck ,  i suggest you rent the elegant universe ,  an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only 3 hour-long episodes .  quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation . 
1	the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil .  the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction .  two brothers ,  andy and hank ,  will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most .   andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  and his younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  couldn't be more different .  andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina  ( marisa tomei )  who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed .  hank ,  however ,  is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife ,  his daughter's expensive school bills ,  and endless amount of child support payments .  a man who means well and has good intentions ,  hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it .   however ,  andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better .  he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears .  the pressure of his life ,  and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up ,  have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again .  of course ,  like hank ,  he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it .  how ?  by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run .  this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers ,  their families ,  and several other lives ,  will be destroyed because of greed ,  pride ,  and fear .    the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told .  after the robbery goes wrong ,  and nanette hanson  ( rosemary harris )  who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed ,  the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt .  we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles  ( albert finney )  to the death of his wife .  the relationship between charles and his two sons ,  especially to andy ,  is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men .  nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story .   philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also ,  in contradictory way ,  as a man we can sympathize with .  ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left .  andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions .   before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face .  more than that ,  our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected .  in what should have been best picture of the year ,  we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives .  in other words ,  there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse .   10/10
0	my 10-year-old daughter ,  alexandra ,  writes :   i thought it was very boring ,  and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from  " 101 dalmatians .  "  i couldn't wait for the movie to end .  the best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done .  the rest of the film is not worth watching .  thank you . 
0	i'm so confused .  i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years .  i've seen all of his films ,  and many of those dozens of times .  i can only describe this film as  " bizarre .  "  steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film ,  but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines ,  with a thin ,  whiny imposter's voice no less .  what i also don't get is ,  if they had to dub some of his lines ,  why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ?  i expect seagal to age like the rest of us .  but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger ,  confidence ,  bravado ,  charm ,  and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies .  what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky ,  self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin .  where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ?  ?  ?  i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us - if so ,  his lifelong fans will have to concede that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone . 
0	five years after the original creepshow ,  another inferior horror sequel is penned by george a .  romero and stephen king :  creepshow 2 .  this time there are only three stories instead of five .  none of the three stories is really original or distinguished either .  the first story is a horror staple ,  formulaic story about a wooden indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners .  the effects are really neat in this story ,  but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough .  george kennedy and dorothy lamour play the elderly store owners .  the second story ,   " the raft "  ,  is a stephen king story .  it's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake .  soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason .  however ,  instead of being suspenseful ,  the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior ,  preventing us from really caring about what happens next .  there is also some unintentional humor in this segment .  the third and final story is  " the hitch-hiker "  ,  which is actually a retread re-adapted for creepshow 2 .  the original story ,  by lucille fletcher ,  was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film .  then it was adapted for a famous twilight zone episode featuring inger stevens .   " the hitch-hiker "  works the best out of these three offerings ,  but it's not without its problems either .  lois chiles plays a cheating spouse ,  who ends up running over a hitch-hiker ,  or so she thinks .  however ,  we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her .  as in many average stories of this type ,  the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns .  the wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place .  tom savini appears as the  " creep "  in this installment .  the good thing is there haven't been any more sequels .  *1/2 of 4 stars . 
0	this sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous  " hero "  vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail .  the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles .  the leering ,  gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting ;  nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause ,  since he is as bad as the people he's fighting .  z-movie editing is abundant ,  including a scene where a character  " dies "  from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely !   the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads ,  barbi benton and lana clarkson ,  who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie .  as a 20-something male ,  i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me .  but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless ,  that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie .   most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted ,  tongue-in-cheek feel  ( the sequel is better in this regard )  ,  but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy .  no way !  avoid at all costs !   rating :  1/2 out of **** . 
0	some guy gets whacked .  right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him .  he's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer ,  but a reporter gets interested .  she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked .  she walks in ,  and corners one bodyguard ,  but he doesn't feel like talking .  i can't figure out why .  it's not like anyone else is interested .  she's the only reporter there .  anyway ,  her editor discourages her from working on this lame story .  but hey ,  she does anyway .  she goes to see the killer's sister & mom .  a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire .  then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital .  she finds him hungover on his boat ,  but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them  ( and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire )  .  the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them .    in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street ,  there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse ,  some car chases with wreckage & death ,  a fake suicide ,  etc .  etc .  lotsa stiffs ,  all kindsa carnage .    great stuff ,  but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is :  why in hell the original guy got whacked .  what's the motivation ?  of course ,  it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested .  through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story .  nobody else in the media cares .  not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies .  true ,  the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity .  his job was a little bit dull .  he was just the president .  yeah ,  the one who lives in the white house .  oh ,  and the bodyguard is a secret service agent .   is that the spoiler ?   it should be .  after all there are no tv cameras ,  no other print reporters ,  no bloggers .  .  .  just another one of those police blotter crimes .  .  .   so what's the spoiler ?   lemme think .  .  .   no !  wait !  the spoiler is that his wife did it !  yeah .  .  .  the first lady .  she was p---ed because the president was fooling around .  and she gets away with it .  she's really sharp ,  huh ?  but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ?  why would anyone bother ?  after all ,  only one reporter is even interested .    i give this move a  " 1 "  .  it was so dumb i just had to keep watching .  and it only got dumber !  that's the real spoiler !  but even though i've told you ,  you've got to see it to believe it ! 
1	robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in  " written on the wind "  to anthony quinn's 12-minute performance in  " lust for life .  "  stack plays the deeply disturbed ,  alcoholic son of an oil tycoon .  he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised ,  mitch ,  played by rock hudson .  they both love the same woman ,  lucy ,   ( lauren bacall )  ,  who becomes kyle's wife .  kyle's sister ,  marylee  ( dorothy malone )  ,  is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch .  their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk ,  who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films ,  including  " imitation of life ,  "   " all that heaven allows ,  "   " magnificent obsession ,  "  and many others .   make no mistake - this is a potboiler ,  and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles ,  malone winning a best supporting actress oscar .  there's one amazing scene ,  mentioned in other comments ,  where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase .  we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone ,  including the guy that pumps the gas ,  because she's in love with mitch .  mitch wants nothing to do with her .  he's so in love with lucy that ,  out of loyalty to kyle ,  he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation .  i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was .   hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life ,  and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety .  sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players .   in sirk's hands ,   " written on the wind "  is an effective film ,  and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting .  the director had a gift for this type of movie ,  and though he had many imitators ,  he never had an equal . 
0	i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this  " horror "  movie .  i did not get scared even once while watching it .  it also is not very suspenseful either .  .  .  .  i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie .  .  .  so .  .  what's left ?    " the ring "  is a trully scary movie .  .  .  i wish other movies would stop copying from it  ( e . g .  the trade-mark :  long hair )  .  please give me some originality .   will not recommend this movie . 
0	summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week ,  given 99 . 9% of the screens dedicated to screening it .  ok ,  so i may exaggerate on the percentage ,  but you get my drift .  besides stuff from hollywood ,  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters ,  and from some of the trailers shown ,  i'm hyped to watch them too .  tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 ,  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas .  when i watched jodha akbar ,  it was a full house ,  but it wasn't for tashan .   after watching it ,  i knew why .  it was entertaining ,  but it was fundamentally weak .  just like it's literal english title ,  which means  " style "  ,  tashan is all style ,  but little substance .  not that it doesn't have the usual star power ,  but scenes felt forced ,  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous ,  even for bollywood standards i must say .  which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya ,  who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 ,  both of which i enjoyed tremendously .    in his rookie directorial outing with tashan ,  while you can't fault his direction ,  you'd probably scratch your head over the plot ,  which was clunky at best .  it tried to force too many things into the story ,  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation ,  but that came a little too late ,  and only toward the finale ,  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie ,  with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil .  and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink ,  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing ,  and the one that took the cake ,  in a dhoom 2 homage ,  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .   at best ,  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy ,  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters .  saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff ,  a call center executive who gives english tuition ,  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material .  his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  ( kareena kapoor )  ,  who's not exactly who she seems ,  the meek and sweet natured hottie .  she engages jimmy's services for her boss ,  mobster bhaiyyaji  ( anil kapoor )  ,  who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it .  and to complete the quartet ,  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey ,  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business .   so begins a road trip of sorts ,  with friends who turned enemies ,  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on .  jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all ,  because he goes from zero to hero ,  executing moves that would shame rambo ,  in absolutely no time ,  which is quite out of character .  kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men ,  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes ,  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee .  every character has a backstory created ,  and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best ,  the most touching and the most fun of the lot ,  even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches .  his wounds also heal automatically ,  which impressively puts wolverine to shame .  and the best part is his theme song ,  which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .   but sad to say ,  that's the only tune that is memorable ,  something that cheers  " bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey "  .  for most bollywood movies i watch ,  i will usually be able to ,  despite the obvious language gaps ,  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two .  i wasn't able to do that after tashan ,  because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all .  usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location .  that i enjoy ,  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain ,  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .   tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously ,  but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story ,  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous ,  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well .  billed as a blockbuster ,  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one .  despite akshay kumr stealing the show ,  tashan could have been better on the whole . 
1	spoilers following :  i picked up the book  " evil angels "  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case .  just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here ,  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt .  the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did .  john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  ( and picked up by the press )  of the arterial spray ,  the actelone  (  ?  ?  )  plates ,  dr .  james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors ,  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up ,  bloody hand print ,  etc .  all quite convincingly .  after all ,  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie ,  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all .  it was also highly technical evidence ,  difficult for a layman to understand .  to this point ,  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials ,  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human ;  people didn't believe it was possible .  the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists ,  whose origins made them appear to be a cult ,  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt .  were it not for dedicated ,  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony ,  finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail .  the book shook me for that reason ,  and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since  ( excepting oj of course )  .  i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better .  i've always liked sam ,  who i could identify with completely ,  and meryl was perfect as always .  beautiful photography ,  haunting music .  i think it's not only a very good ,  but a very important ,  movie .  too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released . 
0	mean spirited ,  and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever .  mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together .  he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film .  the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor .  i have seen a lot of bad film this year ,  but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made . 
1	this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david croft ,  who wrote tv's best programme ever dads army ,  was not as good as dads army ,  but still very ,  very funny .   it is about a concert band in india .  most episodes were about bsm williams  ( windsor davies )  trying to get the concert party ,  who he referred to as a bunch of puffs ,  posted up the jungle .  he was always unsuccessful as the vague colonel reynolds  ( donald hewlett )  and the stupid captain ashwood  ( michael knowles )  were big fans of the concert party .  the concert party consisted of bombadier solomans  ( george layton )  ,  ginger rogers impersonator gunner  " gloria "  beaumont  ( melvyn hayes )  ,  university educated piano player gunner  " la de da "  gunner graham ,  a . k . a padarouski  ( john clegg )  ,  singer gunner  " lofty "  sugden ,  gunner parkins  ( christopher mitchell )   ( williams thought parkins was his son ,  he was quite wrong )  ,  big eater gunner  " nosher "  evans and animal impersonator's  ( kenneth macdonald )  ,  he was no percy edwards .  also ,  heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant rangi ram  ( michael bates )  ,  with the char-wallah and the punkah-wallah  ( dino shafeek and babar bhatti )  giving ram wonderful support .    the show ,  just like dads army left many catchphrases .  rangi ram used to say to his punkah wallah  " don't be such clever dickie "  and he ended a lot of the shows saying  " here is a very old hindu proverb e . g when wife is having affair with best friend ,  it doesn't stop your house from catching fire "  it was williams though who had the most catchphrases .  he would always shout  " shuddup !  !  !  !  !  "  ,  say  " oh dear ,  how sad ,  never mind "  and when talking to gunner graham ,  he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent .   this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as dads army did .  this is probably due to a question of taste :  this is seen as being crude .  williams is homophobic calling his men  " puffs "  ,  though it has to be said williams is a bore .  also ,  some people think there is a racial element in the humour ,  using the fact that michael bates was blacked up to play rangi ram  ( bates was actually born in india though and spoke urdu before he spoke english )  ,  so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on ,  even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist ,  i know someone who is half indian ,  and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show .  when i see an episode for the first time ,  i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom ,  but when i see it second time round ,  i don't laugh all that much ,  but no matter how many times i see dads army ,  i laugh many times in an episode .   best episode :  the road to banu ,  series 1 ,  episode 7
1	dear god where do i begin .  this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen .  the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best .  why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand .  another is the cast .  it is great .  this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure .  i know some of you out there are probably thinking  " no way he has plenty better "  but no your wrong .  raptor island is a work of art .  i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors .  i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever . 
0	this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career .  as is the disney tradition ,  quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in ;  this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie .  instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer ,  which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man' ,  when this kind of thing was done properly .  shockingly ,  this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey ,  who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time . 
1	harvey keital's best performance so far the new century .  very nicely photographed ,  a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba .  the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections .  it's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger ,  much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand . the script is strong and filled with humor ,  the direction is crisp .  over all ,  a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema .  the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us .  unfortunately ,  this just makes the film a little less convincing .  but if you can see beyond this ,  you will find a heartfelt trip to another world .  recommended . 
0	i'm sure that the folks on the texas/louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public .  very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war .  no big cattle empires there ,  they're much farther west in texas ,  farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire .   the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle ,  they keep the cattle .  and that's the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start .   along the way foster marries dix's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors .  they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo .   anyway ,  us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount .  the climax is a blazing ,  and i mean that literally ,  gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production .   but i wouldn't have any but western fans look at it . 
0	i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules :  this movie is aweful !  from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors .  i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination  ( can't extend flaps without engines )  .  the landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity .  that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear .  the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed ,  the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off ,  thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air .  how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground ?  did they forget the spoilers ?  word to the director :  find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a  " plane "  movie .  sorry for the technical rant ,  but i give this movie 1/10 . 
1	one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen .  there isn't much to the plot ,  but the acting- incredible .  you see the characters change ever so subtly ,  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy ,  and love .  and happiness .  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you ,  much as the villa does on all the women .  truly  " enchanted "  . 
0	this is available on a  " drive in double feature "  from dark sky films ,  and since i just had finished up  " barracuda "  ,  i watched this too .  this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town ,  but where exactly are they ?  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor ,  and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop ,  but then we see some aztec dancers ?  and all the while ,  these girls are being followed by two guys ,  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town ,  and they finally catch them .   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck ,  and these guys want to find the loot ,  and where did she get it ?  so ,  in flashback ,  we go back to find out .  and how did they know she had this coin ?  hard to say ,  really .   now ,  back in the day ,  when these two women were 10 years old ,  they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat ,  and after stopped to get air in their tanks ,  they tow this young boy back to his home dock ,  only to have his grandpa come out & invite the  " young 'uns "  up for herbal tea with granny .  but not everyone has the tea ,  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls ,  and then when they're away from it ,  the boat blows up ,  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared .  well ,  it seems as though these  " kindly folk "  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell ,  and serve it herbal tea .   but the girls and todd did leave the island ,  but now ,  they're returning ,  escorted by their captors ,  and they're there to find the treasure ,  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before .  there also seems to be someone else on the island ,  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die ,  one by one ,  and since there's only three ,  it doesn't take long .  and there's even a sort of happy ending ,  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues ,  and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious .  the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability ,  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden ,  who appeared in many films and tv shows .  the action is confusing ,  the locales are even more confusing ,  and the island looks like southern california .   so what the hell is this ?  i'm not sure ,  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  ( or say )  ,  huh ?  4 out of 10 ,  very bizarre . 
0	this early role for barbara shelley ( in fact , her first in britain after working in italy )  , was made when she was 24 years old , and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's  " cat girl .  "  while blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( i'll always cherish yutte stensgaard )  , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960's  " village of the damned ,  "  in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband , george sanders )  . she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of  " cat people ,  "  and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase )  . her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965's  " rasputin-the mad monk "  )  . the ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( i don't see what held that dress up , but i'd sure like to )  . all in all , proof positive that barbara shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at hammer's studios in bray , for the duration of the 1960's . 
1	from the beginning of the show carmen was there .  she was one of the best characters .  why did they get rid of her ?  !  the show not the same as before .  its way worse .   the best episodes were with carmen in them .  you can't replace someone from the beginning !  that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky !  it's not right !  the niece who replaced her is just ,  ugh !  awful .  she doesn't fit into the storyline at all .  she was one of the main characters ,  and the niece can't replace her .  she was an awesome actress .  way better than the niece .  get her back ,  or you'll lose a ton of viewers . 
1	 " the haunted world of edward d .  wood ,  jr .  "  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  " glen or glenda "  ,   " bride of the monster "  ,  and ,  of course ,   " plan 9 from outer space "  .  this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries ,  such as  " look back in angora "  and  " the plan 9 companion "  ,  failed .  it rounds up his surviving entourage ,  many of whom have passed away since filming ,  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work .  nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood ,  sentimental in its treatment of the director  ( down to the haunting music )  ,  this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day .  the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer .  best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater . 
0	okay ,  'enjoy' is a pretty relative term ,  but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus' calibre .   mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous ,  over the top action films i've ever seen ,  without the nasty edge of the exterminator .  other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos ,  but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia ?  all the extras are filipino .  in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor argo as the much reviled 'el presidente' !  oh yes ,  we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader .  there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism . 
1	although the movie is clearly dated ,  audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale .  buster fights against unkindly odds in three different ages :  the stone age ,  the roman age ,  and the moden age ,  playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different  " ages "  .  in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the  " caveman "  stereotype ,  who wins his love not by romance but by brute force ,  as well as a funny twist on roman gladiatorial combat ,  two comedic sketches that long predate such spoofs as mel brooks'  " history of the world :  part i "  .  the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing :  although the times may have-a-changed ,  we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to  " win the girl "   ( keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 america ,  a time when chauvinism was still en vogue )  .  it is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later ,  and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's  " modern times "  to now . 
0	i couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007 ,  it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick .  didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi ?  !  ?  didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic ?  or did i get the purpose wrong ,  was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal ,  bound together in the big cycle of life ,  or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature ,  or something like that ?  ?  it doesn't really matter ,  either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts .   first of all :  the premise is very improbable .  if at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye ,  no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time ,  that's totally unprofessional .  and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient ?  !  and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans ,  and make the victim look like a freak ?  !  by the way ,  i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes ,  couldn't they have waited for such a specimen ?  the story is lame ,  it's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants ,  which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf  ( or at least ,  that's what i make of it )  and then he's being chased by some military men .  especially this last bit is ridiculous .  i mean ,  i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment  ( imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight !  )  but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient ,  it's beyond me why they're out to kill him .  why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient ?   ( a volunteering soldier maybe ?  ?  )  .  and why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor aaron ,  isn't that a bit steep ?  !  who the hell are these militaries anyway ,  i hope not the us army or the government ,  they behave like psychopaths ,  walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons ,  raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1 ,  and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline ,  like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren ,  panicking and shooting randomly around .   aaron ,  for some unfathomable medical reason ,  feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes .  why would that be ?  ?  ?  he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves .  what is this ?  are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls ?  !  ?  and that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red  ( life- )  meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat  ( can a wolf even do that ?  ?  !  )  .   the acting  ( or the lack thereof )  didn't help the credibility of all this either :  everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls ,  especially this indian girl ,  she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression  ( vexed )  and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature ,  and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her  ( but hey ,  there probably had to be at least one love-scene !  )  .  i really sympathized with actor cory monteith ,  who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face ,  but they didn't give him much to go with .  he has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie ,  which could have been fun to watch ,  but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique ,  monteith really should leave his shirt on .  his  ( few )  killings and attacks are hardly shown ,  we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest .  not much for a modern sci-fi horror !  the only good acting came from justine bateman ,  and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady .  she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions ,  but they made her character a kind of a wimp ,  who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries .  what a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more !    in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie ,  hardly scary or thrilling ,  with unbelievable goings-on ,  a lot of overlong national geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes  ( who cares ?  !  ?  )  ,  some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments .  i guess the word  " superfluous "  covers it all . 
0	woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better ,  but it would be hard .  he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda .  not quite so tired and so unfunny ,  his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen ,  is it still our good old woody ?  the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together .  two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers .  it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected .  we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy .  than we begin to see the two points of view .  both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband .  in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason .  the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills .  both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together ,  or make you laugh more than once or twice .  there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own .  they cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year . 
0	as an army veteran ,  i was deeply offended by this film .  in my opinion ,  it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war .  to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement .  if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon  ( it was )  ,  it would have been better received .  but it was taken seriously my many people ,  especially overseas .  silly as it sounds ,  wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film .  unrealistic ?  hmm ,  let's see .  a monosyllabic ,  muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's .  in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats .  and he never misses ,  running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm .  i could go on ,  but i'm getting a headache .  i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii . 
0	after watching this ,  i had lost a little respect for christopher lee  ( this has passed over time )  .  this film was utter garbage .  first ,  they tried to recreate the ending from the first  " howling ,  "  with incredibly bad make-up .  then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film !  the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful !  !  !  !  a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film  ( from the look of it ,  it was supposed to be dee wallace stone ) teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves ,  lead by sybil danning ,  who seems to be naked all the time .   this is not even worth renting  ( unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity .  )  .  try to catch it on cable instead .  it would be so chopped up ,  it may actually make sense . 
1	well i don't personally like rap ,  but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious .  i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes ,  but some i knew ,  and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing .  i'm a big fan of spinal tap ,  so naturally i had to check this out .  it was deriviative from this is spinal tap ,  sometimes blatantly ,  but this film still stood on it's own as an original ,  intelligent ,  and funny satire .  my personal favorite :   " back in the time of slaves ,  they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun ,  so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt .  now we have hats .  " 
1	it does seem like this film is polarizing us .  you either love it or hate it .  i loved it .   i agree with the comment ( s )  that said ,  you just gotta  " feel "  this one .   also ,  early in the film ,  tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet--an impressionist painter .  monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess ,  but from a distance ,  you can tell what the subject is .  cruise mentions that the painting has a  " vanilla sky "  .  i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer .  this movie is like that impressionist painting .  it's impressionist filmmaking !  and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting .   this is not your typical linear plot .  it requires more thought .  there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no ,  you're not always going to be sure what's going on .  but at the end ,  all is explained .   you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it .  after it ends is when you should think about it .  if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding ,  you will overwhelm yourself .  just let it happen .  .  .  " go "  with it .  .  . keep an open mind .  remember what you see and save the analysis for later .   i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique ,  wildly creative ,  and spellbinding .   but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it .  it appeals to a certain taste .  if you like existential ,  psychedelic ,  philosophical ,  thought-provoking ,  challenging ,  spiritual movies ,  then see it .  if you prefer something a little lighter ,  then skip it .   but if you do like what i described ,  then you will surely enjoy it . 
1	by dane youssef    " coonskin "  is film ,  by the one and only ralph bakshi ,  is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes ,  as well as a look at life black in modern america  ( modern for the day ,  i mean--1975 )  .  paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame .   but this is a bakshi film ,  controversial ,  thrilling ,  and a must-see almost by definition alone .  not just another random  " shock-jock "  of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock .  it's by ralph bakshi .  anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie ,  he has something big to say .  .  .   although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation ,   " coonskin "  isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick .   " coonskin "  wants to be more .  it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish .   the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre .  nor does it just indict black people ,  but actually seems to show love ,  beauty and heart in the strangest places .    " coonskin "  tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break .  the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the  " coonskin "  world alone makes it old-fashioned .   one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear ,  brother rabbit ,  preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary .  the itallian mob is running all the real action .   big name black musicians star :  barry white and scatman crothers ,  as well as charles gordone ,  the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer .  something big is happening here obviously .   the movie plays out like a descent into this world ,  this side of the racial divide .  from an angry ,  hip ,  deep ,  soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand .   bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word  " sublety .  "  this one looks like it's never even heard of the word .  but maybe a subject like this needs extremism .  real sledgehammer satire .  some subjects can't be tackled gently .   bakshi is god-dammed merciless .  here ,  no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed .   the characters here are  " animated "  to  " real "  all depending on what the mood and situation are .  the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally .   bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value .  he always has something to say .  nor is black-face is gratuitously .  here ,  unlike in spike lee's  " bamboozled ,  "  he seems to be using it to try and really say something .   like 99 . 9% of all of bakshi's films ,  this one incorporates animation and live-action .  usually at the same time .  bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here .  all of this technique is all intertwined ,  meshing together while saying something .   somehow ,  this one feels inevitably dated .  many of these types of films  ( bakshi's included )  are very topical ,  very spur of the moment .  they reflect the certain trend for the day ,  but looking back of them years later ,  there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia  ( as well as timeless truth )  .   even though the music ,  clothes ,  slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule ,  the attitude ,  the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is .  anyone who's really seen the movies ,  the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about .   even some of the of the black characters are a bunny  ( junglebunny )  ,  a big ol' bear and a fox .  one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these  " dirty n-----s "  after the death of a cop .  but for him ,  it's not just business .  nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield .  it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks .   the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film ,  of which there are many .  it plays out like an opera or a ballet .   the promo line :  warning :   " this film offends everybody !  "  this is not just hype .  proceed with extreme caution .   you have been warned .  .  .   by dane youssef
0	the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time .  when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr .  wellington .   a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor .  in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times :   " chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy "  .   the whole concept does not play as intended :  the  " illusion "  is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all .  the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy ,  because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes ,  is to much of a challenge for the viewers  " suspension of disbelief "  . 
1	absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch .  .  . i highly recommend this movie .  her performance ,  in my opinion ,  was academy award material !  the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format ,  whether it be tape or dvd .  they are ignoring a very good movie .  but universal has little regard for its library on dvd ,  which is sad .  if you get the chance to see this somewhere  ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable )  ,  see it !  i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film ,  and too many  " reviewers "  spend hours writing about the story ,  which is available anywhere .   a 10 ! 
0	the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders ,  what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens .   it is my belief that this film would be the #1 worst film on imdb - if anyone had actually watched it .  the plot is disconnected and ,  in several  ( way too many )  instances ,  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .  the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous  ( but still somewhat better )  film .   i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh . 
0	saw this movie in an early preview ,  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was .  from the very beginning ,  the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent .  poor al looked really ,  really haggard ,  and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist ,  or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set .  much worse than pacino's close ups ,  however ,  is the wretched excuse for a plot .  early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay ,  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended .  later ,  however ,  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  ( both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles )  lust after this elderly ,  half dead looking ,  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent .  the worst part overall was the main plot thread ,  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ,  ever care about in the slightest .  because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment ,  because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing ,  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters . 
0	oh god , what an idiotic movie ! incredibly cheap with fake special effects ( the creature is played by one guy in lame costume ) and stupid plot . all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ( ha ! ha ! ha !  )  .  .  . they're simply ludicrous . for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk ( these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more )  . all in all , this is a great entertainment if you're drunk . avoid it like the plague . am i drunk ? i don't think so .  .  . 
0	in a movie that follows a struggling actor ,  played ,  evidently ,  by a struggling actor ,  this does no favours for chris klein .  he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display ,  what could only be described as ,  a bland leading man .  the story exists ,  but that is all ,  and fails to show any basic start ,  middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened .   one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst ,  who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life .  whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future . 
1	such energy and vitality .  you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best .  of course the choreography is wonderful ,  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight .  don't miss this one . 
0	and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing .  the acting and sound is awful .  this might qualify for a  " so bad it's good "  point of merit ,  ,  , for some .  however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap ,  i think that's my major complaint .  the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times  " you startled me "  is used .  the  " child "  actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended here .  . her line  " donuts !  i hate donuts "  is worth repeated viewing however . 
1	while this movie has many flaws ,  it is in fact a fun '80s movie .  eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here .  while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies ,  his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils .   couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis ,  this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick .   
1	despite the title ,  the sword bearer ,  and the dvd cover  ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer )  this is not a super hero film .    ( minor spoilers )  it follows the tale of sasha ,  the sword bearer ,  who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm .  cool you say ,  but no ,  this is real life .  if you had this power as a child could you control it when ,  say ,  faced by a mad man ,  or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her .  and if you don't control it ,  how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 .   this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him .  wandering aimlessly after another killing  ( much like a bout de soufflé )  .  he then meet katya ,  and the pair fall instantly in love ,  providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways .  however ,  his past is still chasing him ,  in the form of two police officers .   that is essentially the story ,  and there is virtually no action on screen ,  though a lot if suggested .   i really like this movie .  unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films ,  we get very little back story ,  there is no bad guy  ( unless you count the sword bearer himself )  abut there is a lot of heart and good character development .   worth checking out if you can find it . 
1	loved the movie .  loved the two families crossing paths in history .  only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue ?  he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children ?  hmmmmmmmmm .  never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ?  maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit ?  even with the mistakes in the movie .  just loved it .  the acting was great .  not sure where the story was with mr .  sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier .  the other  " counseler "  did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much .  poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up . 
1	the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission ,  as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot ,  filled with gas .   " don't spill it man  !  "  ,  hilarious stuff .  and then ,  as 'the plot' ensues ,  you're in for one heck of a ride .  i watched this film recently and it holds up ,  being just as funny upon each viewing .  check it out . 
0	firstly ,  there are some good things about this film ,  but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie .  in the advertising of this movie ,  that i've seen ,  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it ,  but she's a poor actress ,  and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be  ( not that that has anything to do with the movie )  .  and what's with that look she gives everyone ?  perhaps it's part of the character ,  but like i said ,  the acting .  .  .  still ,  the writing is fine .  you know who it is all throughout the movie ,  and you can almost predict what is about to happen ,  but not in an irritating way .  i think the book it's based on is probably good ,  judging by the plot line ,  but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this . 
0	the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh .  i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies ,  but this just didn't qualify .  it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity ,  which again ,  isn't a bad plot ,  but is done poorly here .  there are some scenes  ( such as the ending )  which are not intended to be funny ,  but actually made me laugh out loud .  there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction ,  but it never fulfills what it could and should be .  in my opinion ,  if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick ,  try silent night ,  deadly night . 
0	i have seen about a thousand horror films .   ( my favorite type )  this film is among the worst .  for me ,  an idea drives a movie .  so ,  even a poorly acted ,  cheaply made movie can be good .  something weird is definitely cheaply made .  however ,  it has little to say .  i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film .  something weird has little to offer .  save yourself the pain ! 
0	ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul ! 
1	the acting is pretty cheesy ,  but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers ,  this is a great movie .  i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny .   jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show !  he looks pretty young here .  .  . 17 years ago .  the opening scene ,  with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great .   leno also owns some bad a** cars now ,  it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection .  i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car .   typical 80s movie .  watch it and enjoy .  no computer generated crap ! 
0	terrible !  !  !  i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid monkey . what a disaster . i just couldn't believe how bad this movie is . the dialogs are just very strange and off topic , the camera work at times just horrible , the music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of arabia , i just watched this film to see how much worse it can get . some of the side kick  " actors "  are total disaster . sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground .  harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film .   .   .   .   .  this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
0	dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .    novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell .  the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .    one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned .  the monk recounts the history of the house  ( which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence )  and then the film simply cuts away to something else .  earlier the monk had offered to help .  well ,  where is the help ?  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house ,  although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care .   there are some  ( probably )  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts ,  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing ,  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud . 
1	yes ,  the cameras were in the right place at the right time .  it's so interesting to see how a world leader  ( like chavez )  who supports the poor people in his country ,  can be held in such low esteem in the us .  his worst  " sin "  ,  in my opinion ,  is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel .  what can be so bad about that ?  i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro .  at first ,  castro was a good guy  ( around 1959 )  when he supplanted batista .  soon ,  however ,  castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats .  we're a decent country ,  but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor ?  if these guys are  " dictators ,  "  then we could use more  " dictatorships "  especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world . 
0	as is often the case ,  films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama .  'downloading nancy' is no exception .  it's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet .   the protagonist is nancy  ( maria bello )  who is married to albert  ( rufus sewell )  .  albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants .  unlike most human beings ,  albert has virtually no positive attributes  ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world )  .  throughout the film ,  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face .  he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes .  when his wife asks for sex ,  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead .   nancy is equally one-note as a character .  not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film )  .  her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result ,  she's forced into therapy .  however ,  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made .   finally ,  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet .  he's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo ,  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot .  it's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  ( the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him )  .   nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her .  there's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass .  these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club .  it seems that louis has a two-fold plan in going to see albert :  1 )  berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 )  enjoy the beating he receives .  it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy's fatefirst ,  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future .  nancy's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her )  .  we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy's murder .   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy ?  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ?  is that the main point of the film ?  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted ?  i don't think so .  the film's writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy's decline .  but are people so one-dimensional in real life ?  i think not .  they have the repulsive louis ,  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain ,  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy .  furthermore ,  his expressions of love towards nancy  ( before he kills her )  ,  is supposed to show his 'sensitive side' .   in the end ,  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film .  they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence ,  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography . 
0	 " scary movie 2 "  is a let down to the scary movie franchise .  scary movie 1 ,  3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny .  luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies .   this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night .  things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape .   this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things .  it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much . 
0	a different look at horror .  the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting .  however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good .  the protagonist ,  marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her .  she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left .  also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film .  then a long time passed before any real suspense built up .  once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else .  the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot .  all in all i'd recommend it for renting ,  but not for theater goers . 
1	despite what others had said  ( *cough* )  ,  this is my favourite movie of all time .  i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it ,  but once i finally did ,  i immediately fell in love .  sure ,  it's strange ,  but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour .  for those who don't know ,  moonchild is one of gackt and hyde's first movies .  they haven't done very many at all ,  maybe 3 or 4 tops each .  so ,  give them some credit .  we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either .  i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there ,  but i over look that to find the best points of this movie ,  the emotions displayed and whatnot .  therefore ,  i have given ,  and always shall give ,  this movie a 10 out of 10 . 
1	the scenes are fast-paced .  the characters are great .  i love anne-marie johnson's acting .  i really like the ending .    however ,  i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship .  it only blossomed when they kissed each other . 
1	not a bad film .  somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan .  the ending on the bus was exhilarating .   the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran ,  and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear .  despite this law ,  some women try to sneak in ,  but many of them get caught and detained .  it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender .  in an interview ,  panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices ,  and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived .  one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later . 
0	though the movie may have been  " true "  to lewis's book  ( in that the script was basically word-for-word ,  verbatim )  ,  it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this .  the mythical creatures  ( unicorns ,  centaurs ,  griffins ,  ghouls ,  ghosts )  are *drawn* in ,  and as in the previous review ,  the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow .  i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ;  i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's  " howl-- "  a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could .   all of the acting is tremendously forced ,  especially that of little lucy penvensie .  .  .  i could only take so much indignation ,  desperation ,  and buck teeth in the  ( what felt like )  fourteen hours of watching the movie .  the actress who plays the white witch ,  in all her histrionics ,  seems that she'd be more at home on stage ,  where a booming voice ,  spread arms ,  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome .    the sets feel claustrophobic ,  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors .  indoors ,  it's as if bbc could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set ,  and so it is very small ,  and all the characters are constantly huddled together .  the white witch's castle is a run-down ,  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting .  when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually ,  *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles .    the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan ,  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline .  it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking ,  but once it starts moving ,  you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit .    yes ,  if you are a hardcore narnia fan ,  you may want to see this version ,  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote-- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter ,  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen .  during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves ,  mrs .  beaver's incessant ,   " oh ,  just one more thing ,  dearies ,  and then we will be ready to go ,  "  punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  " no ,  mrs .  beaver ,  please !  "  -- a scene of comic relief ,  so incongruous  ( they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger ,  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not )  ,  detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have .  in fact ,  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these .    i would recommend seeing the new narnia  ( disney 2005 )  .  the new movie ,  with updated effects ,  spectacular computer animation ,  great timing all around ,  and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch  ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician ,  as opposed to a shrieking banshee )  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision  ( i think )  .  lucy is a lot cuter  ( no buck teeth ,  yay !  )  ,  as are the beavers  ( and realistically-sized )  ,  and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine ,  desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts .    unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies ,  i would not recommend this film to anyone . 
1	as i said in my comment about the first part :  these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess .   the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization ,  but the aftermath ,  thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans ,  protected by only one powerful spaceship .   but when battlestar pegasus appears ,  the story heats up ,  carrying the battle back to the cylon planets .  okay ,  it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth ,  but it works for me .  it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects  ( even though those tend to repeat themselves ,  to say the least  : - )   )  .   i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board .  instead ,  we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen .  .  .   so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 ,  but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 . 
1	new york i love you is full of love and power .  not for everybody ,  however ,  but is a beautiful movie .   it has the likes of shia labeouf  ( seen in transformers ,  disturbia ,  charlies angels ,  i robot ,  indiana jones ,  and many more )  ,  maggie q ,  kevin bacon ,  blake lively ,  natalie portman ,  and many more .  with a star-studded cast ,  this movie is without a doubt ,  brilliant .   from many top-notch directors around the world ,  it does not fail to impress .  the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique .   it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie ,  and should be watched on a big tv !  this time ,  trust the imdb rating ,  because it is an excellent film .   eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010 .    watch ny ily ,  you won't be disappointed . 
1	mesmerizing ,  breathtaking and horrifying ,  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  " apocalypse now "  without fiction .  slow in pace ,  quiet in mood ,  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom .   there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease .  greed ,  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress ,  has turned us into something like cancer ,  on its way to consume the host and die with it .  .  .   manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again . 
1	i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out ,  and to this day still do .  a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore .  it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day .  this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl .  wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed .  sure ,  it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone ,  and indiana jones .  but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar .  i am surprised not too many people know about it .  it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86 .  i watched it back then on cable tv .  it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd .  i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks !  cool flick . 
0	watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels .   i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie ,  but were extremely disappointed .   the actor playing the soldier ,  seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever ,  his face looks the same ,  whether he's chopping down christmas tree's ,  seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend ,  or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves ,  he's an awful actor ,  and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him .   then there's the cute blond girl ,  blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend ,  what a catch !  and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots .   so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend ,  it's as predictable as it get's ,  and really a waste of time ,  you gain nothing by watching this ,  other than some weird laughs ,  because it's all so corny .   i love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine ,  and they all laugh ,  that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about ,  furthermore ,  if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like ,  i'd tell him a thing or to ,  but not our army veteran ,  no sir ,  he let's everyone boss him around .   the movie is what first blood would have been ,  if john rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world . 
0	i have two good things to say about this film :  the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance  ( considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction )  .  however ,  that said ,  i found this film extremely tiresome .  watching paint dry would have been more entertaining .  it seemed much longer than 97 minutes .  beginning with opening sequence ,  where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone ,  the movie is annoying .  the film is filled with clichés and shtick ,  not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk .  also ,  the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears .  there are some sequences that are touching ,  but they're all played for laughs .  if schmaltzy ,  sentimental ,  and  " cute "  appeal to you ,  you'll love it .  but if you were hoping for something with more substance ,  see a different movie . 
1	i've had a lot of experience with women in russia ,  and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like ,  unfortunately .  they are very cunning ,  ruthless ,  and greedy ,  as well as highly unfair .  from the robotic sex ,  the hustling for gifts ,  to the lies and betrayal ,  i've experienced it all in russia .   i know what i'm talking about .  and here are my qualifications :  here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride .  it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met ,  black comedy ,  scams i was privy to ,  and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv .   http : //www . happierabroad . com/photojournals . htm  it's like reality tv .  you will love it .  i spent a ton of time putting it together .  so check it out .  the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals .   my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell ,  so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia ?  however ,  there is one factual impossibility in this film ,  and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport .  it doesn't work that way at all ,  so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this .  there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way ,  and i challenge anyone to find one that does .  the fact is ,  you can only order the russian lady's contact info  ( email ,  address ,  phone number ,  etc .  )  from the website .  from there ,  you correspond and then visit her ,  and if you want to bring her to your country ,  you start the immigration process at your ins office ,  and wait months after that .  that's how it works in real life .  you can't just order her to arrive at your airport .  us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen .   wumaster   - i got everything i wanted by going abroad !  you can too !  http : //www . happierabroad . com
0	i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend ,  and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie .  .  . any movie .  and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget ,  we decided to go in for that .   big mistake .  this is a movie that might appeal only to kids .  oh ,  and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience .  but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention .  if you have nothing to do at home ,  go to sleep .  better than wasting hard-earned cash on this .  go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid  :  ) 
0	ah ,  bait .  how do i hate thee ?  let me count the ways .  1 .  you try to be funny ,  but are corny and unenjoyable ;  every joke is predictable and expected ,  and when it comes ,  does not inspire laughter .  instead ,  i want to hurl .  2 .  you try to be dramatic ,  but are unbelievable ;  the woman overacts to a terrible degree ,  and the  " bad guy "  looks like bill gates ,  and is about as scary as .  .  . well ,  bill gates .   ( just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun .  doesn't work ,  does it ?  a lawyer ,  maybe ,  but not a gun .  doesn't fit .  )  as for jamie foxx ,  well ,  just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous ,  and makes me want to hurl .  3 .  you try to be action-packed ,  but instead are dull and dragging too many times .  and when the action heats up ,  the tripod for the camera must have been lost ,  for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project ,  and i find myself nauseated ,  and once again i want to hurl .  4 .  you try to be a good movie ,  but you failed ,  you failed ,  you failed !  i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water ,  no sunscreen ,  and only meryl streep for company .  this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy ,  and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx's character has just driven off a cliff ,  but somehow manages to escape .  .  . just kill me now ,  or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ,  ever again . 
1	this movie has great fight scenes .  now its true that the acting is a little rough .  but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty .  but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix .  then watch this .  now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie .  but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants .  and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire . 
0	the only film i've ever walked out on .  amazing ,  since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap .  but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on ,  particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged .   from the beginning to the end this film offends .  worse ,  it ain't funny .  it wasn't funny then ,  and it sure ain't funny now .  but even worse ,  is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart ,  sophisticated comedy .  it's juvenile ,  really sophomoric script and ideas began an era  ( which continues to this day )  where cheap laughs ,  and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film .   sexual olympics ?  what high school kid hasn't thought of that ?  the beginning of the end . 
1	i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s .  it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation .  i'm not sure that squares with the facts .   still the film is well done .  the german high command reports wryly without emotion  " the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse "  as if all went according to plan .   it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler .  i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper .   i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic .  the american knock-off was a little flat .   few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph .  yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece .   was gibs ? 
0	if this film had a budget of 20 million i'd just like to know where the money went .  a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage ,  although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really ,  really cool on an original play-station 1 game ,  and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made .  what puzzles me is where did the money go ?  pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 ,  and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing  ( or ruining in this case )  for about the same 20 million .  this is quite possibly the worst film ever made !  i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again .  i hated it completely !  i regress .  i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes ,  or santa claus conquers the martians ,  these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them ,  you love them .  there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it .  i sold it to a guy for a dollar .  i'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew .  shame on you pendragon films !  i want my money back ! 
0	if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics ,  spend your $9 on a used textbook ,  not this movie .  i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana .    i don't think the directors really got any point across ,  but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several :  1 )  science can explain everything we do ,  meaning that our lives are deterministic ;  2 )  science can't be used to explain everything we do ,  meaning that we have free will ;  3 )  science is ,  like ,  really cool ,  brother ;  4 )  we are god ;  5 )  the world exists only in our minds ;  6 )  sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7 )  here ,  put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff . 
0	first off ,  the title character is not even the main character of the movie .  he is the sidekick of the cult leader .  the actor who portrays igor believed that screaming loud ,  laughing hysterically ,  and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people .  igor also had the annoying habit of yelling  ( because he never actually just spoke )  in a high pitched voice .  he would also say idiotic one-liners .  for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw ,  igor upon seeing this ,  yells out  " paul !  no paul !  why'd you do it ?  i could have cut her clean !  so clean !  "  in another scene igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now ,  it was his time to operate . ' aside from the bad acting ,  the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax ,  which is igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed ,  he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys' .  the movie offers no explanation of this ,  only telling the viewer that igor escaped from the mental hospital .  what ?  ?  ?  bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie .  i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this . 
0	an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes ,  including improper use of a broom ,  are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge ,  new jersey ,  by a  " mildly retarded "  student  ( heather matarazzo )  .  the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da's office ,  where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge .   rumors about the case spread through glen ridge ,  an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community .   ( one of their fathers is a police lieutenant .  )  nobody believes matarazzo .   " our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement ,  rape her ,  and subject her to such sexual humiliation .  "  the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial .  matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff .  she's desperate for love and friendship ,  and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements .  a slimy reporter says ,   " you can trust me ,  "  but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all .  another student ,  a very popular girl in school ,  pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo ,  pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results !  as a consequence ,  watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster .  at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz .  but then ,  oops ,  the community organizes against the law .  then it looks good again .  but then the reporter interferes .  then that obstacle is no sooner overcome ,  than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying .   ( well ,  actually ,  she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her .  )  then that's overcome ,  but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be characterized as  " retarded .  "  eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor .  i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time .   ( i hope he wasn't the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club .  if he was ,  i take back my compliment .  )  ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize .  she did a marvelous self-restrained job in  " fine art "  but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role ,  which was rather formulaic anyway .  i mean ,  neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what's essentially a comic book story .   the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim .  the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely ,  neotenous blond .  instead ,  matarazzo ,  without being at all ugly ,  looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up .  nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle .  she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to ,  which is all for the good .   matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film .  the jocks are stereotypes .  pure evil .  they think themselves above the law ,  barge in on some nice girl's party in east orange ,  trash the place during a party far worse than  " la dolce vita's "  climactic orgy ,  and leave without explanation or apology .  they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do .   i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is .  it challenges none of our prejudices .  it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil .  and we don't have a moment's doubt about who's who .  what i'm waiting for -- not really ,  that's just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others ,  but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of us .   the film is based on a true story ,  as are so many others we've all seen ,  and even more fictional features .   ( eg .  ,   " the accused "  .  )  some are good ,  some are strictly routine .  okay .  fair enough .  now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case ,  in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days ,  then had her friends strip her ,  tie her up ,  and smear her with dirt ,  so she could claim she'd been abducted and raped by the police ?  now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not . 
0	when converting a book to film ,  it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts ,  rather than ignoring the author altogether .  while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart's children ,  it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good ,  enriching ,  strengthening experiences of homesteading her land .  the book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier ;  she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances ,  though they lived dozens of miles apart .  the film ,  however ,  takes a standard stance for the time it was made ,  portraying this woman's experience as harsh ,  unforgiving ,  and nearly pointless .  perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie  ( as some film aficionados have said )  ,  but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak ,  odious landscape devoid of friends or hope .  don't waste your time with this movie ;  read the book instead . 
0	reading my review of the house that screamed ,  many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered  " classic "  horror .  this is not the case ,  as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life .  but admittedly ,  i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal ,  etc .  .  . types of horror films - so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced .  just like someone who can appreciate different music ,  painting ,  or in this case ,  film - but not necessarily like them - i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film .  .  . i just don't .  .  .   the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls .  the heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand  ( or whip in some cases .  .  .  )  to keep the girls in line .  she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower  ( in their nightgowns no less  (  ?  !  ?  )  .  .  .  )  ,  and meanwhile ,  girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus .  .  .   i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria  ( which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion .  .  .  )  ,  in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake .  i'm all for  " tension "  and  " suspense "  in horror films - but this film held neither for me .  luckily ,  i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one ,  so i can't say i was really disappointed - the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's .  this isn't a hard and fast rule ,  but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception .  probably a  " must-see "  for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material ,  i can't really recommend this one .  .  . 4/10
1	i've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life  ( eg what it takes to get into music school )  ,  britney bashing ,  etc ,  etc .  so let's focus on the movie and the message .   i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years ,  and for a family movie .  for the average adult male .  .  .  .  2 out of 10 .   i like pop/rock music ,  i'm 45 .  i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews .  i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion' .   i watch movies to be entertained .  i don't care about casting ,  lighting ,  producers ,  directors ,  etc .  what is the movie and does it entertain me .   i watched this movie for the message .  the world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem  ( which is a whole other story )  so watched with the message in mind ,  as that is an area of interest .  the movie is light ,  bright and breezy ,  great for kids .  i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message ,  so yeh ,  it was a bit predictable .  great message though .  .  . should be more of them .   this movie is a great family movie ,  but for a bloke watching by himself ,  get hannibal . 
1	this film is a great example of fine storytelling .  the acting is superb .  the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake .  there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were ,  but considering it is a hollywood movie ,  they showed amazing restraint .  there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie ,  even though they had one opportunity to .  the film ,  while having suspenseful parts ,  was not made into an action movie .  the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times .  well done ! 
0	this might be unbelievable ,  but this movie has grossed $878 , 138 in russia !  it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running !  well ,  i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh  " movie "  ,  which had almost no screening around the world .  that's some kind of enigma !  haha !  maybe it was based on the fact that another movie ,   " pledge this "  with paris hilton ,  which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere ,  had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln$ .  besides ,  both movies had a lot of promotion ,  like there were the banners all over the city ,  tv commercials and etc .  speaking about movie ,  i'd say it's dull and absolutely boring .  it could be better ,  really .  even if it has jessica simpson . 
0	given the history of the director of this movie ,  it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through .  i was at the european premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there .  he was yet to see the movie and ,  boy ,  was he in for a surprise .  i have not read the book that this is based upon ,  nor do i know if it highly rated or appreciated ,  but i have read  " captain correlli's mandolin "  and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was ,  i can only presume that something similar has happened here .  the acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from farrell .  honestly ,  i can't believed how little i cared for any character in this movie .  situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness .  donald sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door ,  says something and closes it again .  i kept looking at my watch when i wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen .  i have never walked out on a movie but i was tempted to start during this .  i gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that i can say about this movie .  the first is that i really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that salma hayek got naked and looked beautiful .  i can say little else positive about this movie .  don't ask the dust anything ,  it can't talk ! 
1	john waters has made the most effusively buoyant ,  heartfelt ,  dark ,  personal little film i think i've ever seen  ( well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second )  the directors vision is untainted .  .  . the narrative is whimsical ,  the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life  .  .  . the tone never forced or stylistically over-arch .   there is no pretentious shot design ,  ennui ,  or magazine grading .  .  .  . martha plimpton is amazing as the sister .  . eddie furlong is inspired casting .  a grandmother with a talking mary ,  tea-bagging ,  recycled clothing ,  yesterday's garbage becomes today's art -- and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family  .  .  .  and a humble life . 
0	ummm ,  please forgive me ,  but weren't more than half the characters missing ?  in the original novel ,  valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape .  he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert .  along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version .  some worth mentioning would be fantine ,  cosette ,  m & mme .  thenardier ,  eponine ,  marius ,  gavroche ,  and enjolras .  the only character with the same name is javert .  i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie ,  trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor hugo's epic novel . 
1	few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later ,  yet remain as engrossing as this one .  technological advances have not dated this classic love story .  special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie .  the acting is superb .  david niven ,  kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job .  the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie .  it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence .  it is my favorite movie of all time .  waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is ,  in itself ,   " a matter of life and death "  . 
0	oh my god !  please ,  for the love of all that is holy ,  do not watch this movie !  it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back .  sure ,  i could have stopped watching half way through .  but i thought it might get better .  it didn't .  anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual .  no wonder us australians/new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies .  everything about this movie is horrible ,  from the acting to the editing .  i don't even normally write reviews on here ,  but in this case i'll make an exception .  i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
0	i just saw this movie ,  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time .  the girl who played eva  ( ellen fjaestad )  can't act at all .  she read her lines very un-naturally ,  and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie .  rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand ,  is a natural .  she played her part with great perfection .   spoilers !  the story was simple - we've seen it many ,  many times before .  she breaks up ,  he finds another ,  she get jealous ,  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end .  there were no surprises at all ,  one knew that eva would break up ,  and that adam would  " hook up "  with petra .  the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party .  she became all serious ,  which is a side of petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie ,  and told him to win eva's heart back ,  which was really cute .   besides rosanna munter ,  there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance .   this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors ,  so i don't recommend it ! 
0	after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover ,  i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good .  nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features .  .  . but when i played the movie itself ,  what a let down .  it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time .  the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film .  so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash ! 
0	i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies ,  but this one is a real stinker !  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it .  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching .  he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .   angie harmon ,  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president ,  truly butchered the role .  there was no chemistry with gooding ,  her demeanor was flat and wooden ,  and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd .  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  " b "  list .   and what was cuba gooding thinking ?  ?  ?  he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances ,  but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him .   poor james woods and burt reynolds .  poor poor poor poor poor . 
0	ah ,  lucio fulci ,  rest in peace .  this infamous italian is most  famous for  " zombie ,  "  and the absolutely unwatchable  " the  psychic "  and  " manhattan baby .  "  well ,  add this to the unwatchable  list .   the plot ,  as it were ,  concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold  mask and a g-string .  she wants the power of a young dubbed  stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow .  they are magic  because they glow .  arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig ,   and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat  action sequences .  in the end ,  the nekkid chick is defeated ,  but not  before taking the mask off and reminding me why i broke up with  my high school girlfriend .   fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with  smoke .  nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you  crave sunny delight and a cigarette .  the special effects are  laughable .  in one sequence ,  our ambiguously gay duo are  attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on  the film itself .  the majority of the effects budget must have been  spent on the fulci-licious gore ,  which consists entirely of spurting  wounds .  hey ,  we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while ,  but when you get into spurting wound overkill ,  it gets boring .   i kept having to play with the brightness setting on my tv anyway  just to see what the heck was happening .   there is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies ,  so let me  do a little look into the future .  .  . if you find this movie and watch it ,   you will regret it .  the scene on the video box  ( by media )  does not  appear in the film in any context whatsoever .   " conquest "  is a con  job .  what mst3k could have done with this !   this is rated  ( r )  for strong physical violence ,  strong gore ,  female  nudity ,  brief male nudity ,  and mild sexual content .   
0	after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was :  is this supposed to be irony or not ?  after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series ,  i knew this film was not meant to be ironic .  so ,  the story tells us about an us-american super-doc saving a south american republic from evil .  sounds like a typical story .  but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous .  the mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen .  the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example . 
0	it is enjoyable and fast-paced .    there is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen .  however ,  the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly .  it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him .  i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy .   while his was the best performance ,  most of the others were also very engaging .  in particular ,  the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced ,  and worked very well .   it is only about 45 minutes long ,  so the plot is not complex .  more key is the style of the whole thing .  it is very slick and vibrant ,  and the backdrops are atmospheric ,  especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich .  the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences ,  but still manages to be distinctly australian . 
0	i just watched this movie on starz .  let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ;  the acting ,  writing ,  directing ,  special effects ,  camera crew ,  sound ,  and lighting .  it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie .  apparently back in 2007 ,  when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million .  now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible .  apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour .  there was a completely random lesbian scene ,  which i didn't mind ,  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it .  the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes .  oh yeah ,  since its a steven segal movie ,  its predictable as hell .  all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane . 
0	the shame of it !  there i was ,  comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn ,  bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment .  what did i get ?  disappointed !  how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this ?  the humour was dreadful ,  the songs were worse than country and western  ( and that's saying something )  and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew .  i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island .  a short tale ,  such as christmas carol ,  is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it .  .  .  . here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun .  where do the muppets go next ?  how about muppets wizard of oz ? 
1	this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town .  one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever .  definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you !  a powerful piece of work .  this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time .   *spoiler !  !  !  spoiler alert !  !  spoiler !  ! *  the main character is taken by her young ,  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms .  her two jealous  " friends "  play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy .  she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop .  in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .  ( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted ) 
0	this movie sucked plain and simple .  okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped ,  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist .  the rapist is a douche ,  but the girl victim is partly to blame .  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff ,  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her ,  she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her .  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything ,  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped ,  it's a pretty long rape scene .  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching .   3 . 2/10
1	frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell  ( a fine performance by george e .  carey ,  who also produced this picture )  can't stand his naggy ,  frigid wife edith  ( a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy )  anymore .  worse yet ,  poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter  ( dishy brunette sheri jackson )  .  george has an adulterous fling with lovely ,  enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson  ( delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer )  .  complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman  ( a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams )  ,  who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey  ( a frightening robert tessier ,  who sports a head full of hair here )  from jail .  director tom laughlin  ( yep ,  the same dude who portrayed billy jack !  )  and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity ,  sizzling soft-core sex ,  and raw violence .  moreover ,  they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time ,  thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome .  one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking ,  wailing rock music ,  and ,  of course ,  hot naked dancing chicks .  robert o .  ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot .  stanton fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on .  best of all ,  this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer ,  who positively lights up the screen with her sweet ,  bubbly personality and captivating beauty .  a total trashy treat . 
1	on paper this looked like a great concept :  average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator ,  who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis .  however ,  director ivan reitman and writer don payne  ( of the  " simpson's "  )  almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl  ( played by striking uma thurman )  come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson .  the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders  ( luke wilson )  following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty .  jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like .  matt replies ,   " she's kind of nutty "  i think the intent was to have jenny  ( thurman )  be this lonely young woman ,  who has no one in her life ,  isolated by her great physical powers .  thurman does the best she can ,  but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac .  luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend .    " my super ex-girlfriend "  is also a victim of bad timing ,  coming on the tail end of  " superman returns "  which plays superhero straight up ,  so to speak .  with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought  " my super ex-girlfriend "  was funny and enjoyed the movie .  given that this is an ivan reitman movie ,  this could have been a lot better .  reitman starts with a great premise ,  and really squanders it .  first off ,  we all love the hero .  here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable .  this is surprising for uma thurman ,  who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence .  in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird .  shocking .  because if there is a woman who can play a superhero ,  she is thurmanshe looks great .  only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic ,  instead of caricature .  although  " my super ex "  is not a straight superhero story ,  rather a romantic comedy of sorts ,  it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain .  here we have professor bedlam aka barry  ( eddie izzard )  who really is evil lite .  he is no lex luthor .  no plans for global domination .  bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl ,  and expectedly it has to do with their shared past .  what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl ?  luke wilson's matt is just  " some dude "  who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero .  one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn  ( rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation )  .  wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense ,  and this dilutes his likable charm .  this does however work ,  in the comic sex scene with jenny .  matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah  ( perky anna faris )  .  so how does matt break up with g-girl ?  well ,  it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious .   dramatic superhero movies work .  romantic comedies with chemistry work .  what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies .  everyone loves the hero .  however ,  hero nut job ?  maybe not .  with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly .  and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne .  thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings .   " my super ex-girlfriend "  is fun and funny .  though given all involved ,  the movie could have been super . 
0	this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be .  i dread to think what the blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like ,  because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions .  naturally ,  you don't expect it to be  " the godfather "  ,  but an acting class or two might have come in handy .   also ,  there were so many cute guys in this movie ,  but they were woefully under-exploited .  i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy ,  but even i have a right to expect a little more .  it wasn't a total loss ,  though ;  at least we got a peek a drew fuller's  ( covered )  junk and truly upsetting haircut .  and there's huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  " bring it on "   ( and acting about as well )  .  there's always a silver lining ,  kids .  you just have to look really hard for it .  and occasionally ,  you have to make use of your pause button . 
0	this film has its good points :  hot chicks people die  the problem .  .  .  the hot chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing ,  mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes .   also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side chearator with a very small role and minor nude scenes .   what this film needed .  .  script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that .  .  simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks .  .  .   i wouldn't waste my money on it .  .  . and if you must ,  wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store
0	if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action ,  unbelievable stunts  ( unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here )  ,  and retarded dialogue ;  you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung .  i had high hopes based on the trailer .  i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his  " has-been "  days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story ,  setting ,  and  ( believable )  action would prevail .  i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event .  my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous .  judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie .  the character ,  setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves .  cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say  " yo ,  adrian !  "

0	considering its popularity ,  i found this movie a huge disappointment .  maybe i was expecting too much from this film .  after all ,  it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s ,  but i could never figure out why .  the story is uninteresting .  it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences .  my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for ,  since the intended hero is an idiot .  director chang has no sense of style ,  and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative .  i know this is not supposed to be high art ,  but i found the movie boring .  definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre .  its cult status escapes me .  i recommend you to skip it . 
1	i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users  ( some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever . ' what ?  ?  haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave ?  )  my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid ,  and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on .  duh !  what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie ?  did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story ,  then just loaded it up with action ?  of course not !  black mask is awesome ,  wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time .  it's also deliciously gruesome ,  and we get plenty of severed limbs ,  decapitations ,  and creative ways of watching the bad guys  ( and quite a few innocent people ,  too !  )  get slaughtered .  most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask ;  there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence ,  bloodshed ,  or action sequences whatsoever !  and that made me a happy camper .  again :  if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot ,  you are going for the wrong reasons .  black mask is probably my favorite of his movies  ( though ,  beware of the horrendous dubbing )  . 
0	really ,  i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie .  i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad .  it had zombies in it right ?  was i wrong !  to be honest the movie had it's moments .  .  . i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it .  overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .  the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that .  buyer beware .  .  . unless you are into masochism . 
0	i really wanted to love this show .  i truly ,  honestly did .   for the first time ,  gay viewers get their own version of the  " the bachelor "  .  with the help of his obligatory  " hag "  andra ,  james ,  a good looking ,  well-to-do thirty-something has the chance of love with 15 suitors  ( or  " mates "  as they are referred to in the show )  .  the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this .  if james picks a gay one ,  they get a trip to new zealand ,  and if he picks a straight one ,  straight guy gets $25 , 000 .  how can this not be fun ?  !  take my hand ,  lets stroll :    the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself .  james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body ,  the one you'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures .  why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me .  god knows there's so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on tv .   aside from his rather average physical appearance ,  james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk .  even as such ,  he has this arrogant ,  smugly condescending aura about him .  however ,  if james were standing up against a blank ,  white wall he'd meld right into in it .  i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show .  he is that boring and forgettable .  in fact ,  one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection .  i thought that was the best part of the show .  also ,  james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt .  sound feminine or sound masculine ,  but don't ****ing segue tones in the middle of sentences .  .  . so painful to sit through .  i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking ,   " please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag "   then we have the suitors .  a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening .  equally vapid ,  they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except ,   " hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair "  again ,  astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show .  while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles ,  it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones .  however ,  in all their banality they still manage to upstage james  ( which isn't all that hard to do anyway )  ,  slightly that is .  you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man .  and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man ?  very sad .   also ,  i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true :  the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys .    don't get me wrong ,  im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring ,  as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute .  it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette .   i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show .  i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box ,  i can accept the mundane ,  apathetic suitors but please for the love of god entertain me just a little .  no such luck .   if you're expecting drama ,  intrigue ,  sexiness ,  or excitement you will be severely disappointed .  the biggest  " drama "  comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in new york  ( how scandalous !  )  .  as titillating as that may be i guarantee you ,  that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show .   sure there is the twist ,  but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you ,  you'll easily discern who's who  ( it wasn't hard at all ,  i was only wrong once .  )  this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else .   we get to watch as james & co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance ,  shopping for gifts ,  visiting a petting zoo ,  and gay karaoke .  yawn .  sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway .  that's one of main problems with the show :  no one seems to be enjoying themselves--they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time .  and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame .   finally ,  the physical aspect is not there .  there's no cuddling ,  no caressing ,  no kissing  (  !  )  ,  no endearment of any sort .  it's just  " ok that was a boring date ,  im gonna go back to my ugly ,  tacky wanna-be sydney operahouse dwelling  ( quick peck on the lips )  cya .  "  this show is so ****ing prudish it's ridiculous .  i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men ,  but come the **** on .  people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses .  this show refuses to compromise .   sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed .  i do commend bravo for first putting up a show of this nature ,  but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling .  to summarize my three points :  boring + boring + boring = go do something else .  you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment ,  at least they have interesting magazines there . 
1	'holes' was a great movie .  disney made the right choice .  every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it .  everyone casted was fit for the part they had ,  and shia labeouf really has a future with acting .  sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden ,  she was exactly how i imagined her .  everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it' . 
0	i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of ,  and those i found made this one look unmissable .  how misled i feel !   firstly ,  it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie .  the performances are wooden ,  every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are ,  and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men  ( particularly soldiers )  are essentially violent and incompassionate .  the whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension .   if that sounds tolerable  ( or even enjoyable )  to you ,  then be warned .  linda hamilton's german accent ,  while quite good ,  is painfully distracting - as is her face ,  for some reason .  the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators ,  with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day .  there are few surprises ,  but do watch for the 'monty pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks !   i wasn't expecting action ,  but i had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged .  what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all .   watch it under the folowing circumstances :  1 :  there's nothing else on .  2 :  you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' tv movies .  3 :  the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film .  4 :  you've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling . 
0	if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman - the animated series ,  i ,  for one ,  think it failed terribly .  the character drawing is lousy .  .  .   ( catwoman ,  for instance ,  looks awful .  .  .  )  but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle ,  without the help of two ,  even three sidekicks .  i mean ,  he's batman ,  for god's sake !  i know the comic books ,  i know that nightwing and batgirl are supposed to be batman's allies ,  besides robin ,  but still .  .  .  making batman say that he needs help from them .  .  .  what ,  he can't handle a few punches ?  in btas ,  he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem .  .  .  he's getting old ?  come on .  .  .   and another thing :  i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon ,  without years of hard training .  one ,  it's irresponsible  ( and batman is everything ,  but irresponsible )  ,  and two ,  it's not what happened in the comics ,  if we are to remain faithful to them .   batman - the animated series made history ,  with its animation ,  its stories and its characters .  .  .  that really was a legend of batman .  the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick . 
1	as i am always looking for something new and unique ,  i watched this film online .  i thought that it would be just another  " b "  rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters .  all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed .  the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story .   this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp ,   " dumb and dumber "  or blood and guts .  this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting .   i would prefer this movie to many  " a "  rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office earnings .   i highly recommend this movie . 
1	what a pleasant surprise :  a disney dtv  ( direct to video )  sequel that's actually good .   " the lion king 1 1/2 "  is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog ,  timon and pumbaa .  it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments ,  until timon complains that  " we're not here yet "  .  after fighting over the remote ,  timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience  " their story "  .  they start the new movie ,  and the laughs begin .   to be honest ,  i was losing hope in disney .  most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful ,  with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original .   " 1 1/2 "  decides to try something different :  it tells the original story from a new point of view .  okay ,  it adds some stuff ,  like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met ,  but it's an interesting concept .  nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie .  there's also some neat movie parodies  ( including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good ,  the bad ,  and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke )  ,  and the script is filled with funny memorable lines .   added to the cast are julie kavner  (  " the simpsons "  )  as timon's worry-wart mom ,  and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max .  matthew broderick shows up as simba ,  and his  " teen "  scene reminded me of ferris bueller .  everyone does well ,  especially robert guillame  ( is that how you spell it ?  )  as rafiki ,  who exudes more and more yoda-speak in this movie  ( timon comments on this several times )  .   'the lion king 1 1/2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation .  10/10
0	the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality ,  psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history .  take a well-know genius you have not read ,  describe him as demented ,  include crazy physicians to cure him ,  a couple of somewhat good looking women ,  have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache ,  have every character speak with the strongest accent ,  show ridiculous dreams ,  include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one  ( freud )  ,  mention a few words used in the genius' works ,  overdo everything you can ,  particularly music ,  and you are done .  audience ,  please stay away . 
1	most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality ,  hence ,  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 ,  part 3 ,  etc .   now with that said ,  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it .  yes ,  it's true ,  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min ,  but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters .  the guy who lies about everything is too funny ,  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss ,  actually .  .  .  .  getting into all the characters here could take quite a while ,  but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while .   audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was .  in fact ,  as irene ,  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first .  in this film ,  irene is a girl with good intentions ,  but over the course of a  ( very awful )  day ,  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building .  .  .  very entertaining to watch ,  great scenery and shots ,  very colorful and never too slow ,  and all of the characters can actually act .  the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .  .  .  .  this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense ,  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms .  i swear ,  it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while ,  and the ending .  .  .  .  it made me think  " damn i really lucked out finding this movie "  .  the ending to this movie is top notch .  whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant ,  because not only are there all these other subplots going on ,  but to somehow make them all tie in together  ( and in a sensible manner ,  which is the case here )  but also to make each character feel human and come alive ,  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect .  .  .  very impressive .   i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime ,  in any mood ,  with any company or alone . 
0	 " true "  story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters .  amusing ,  though not really good ,  monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way .  give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy .  an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind .   ( my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago .  ) 
1	i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror .  there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf ,  just the title alone peaked my curiosity .  so i decided to check it out and i was surprised .  .  . it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story .  is it low budget ?  yes .  can you tell that it's low budget ?  yes .  .  . but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter .  i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice !  i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film .  all i hear is  " worst movie ever "  .  have these idiots seen every movie out there ?  there's thousands of movies out there ,  how can you categorize one as the  " worst "  ever ?  a video not  " movie "  like  " zombiez "  may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there .  bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs .  listen ,  if you don't like minority based ,  urban films ,  the ghetto films ,  hip hop , etc then why watch these types of movies ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  knowing that you don't like this type of stuff ?  sure ,  this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast .  i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o . c .  ,  they suck to me .  films like  " garden state "  ,   " wedding crashers "  and  " i heart huckabees "  suck to me .  i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me .  why ?  because i can't relate to them .  they don't peak my interest .  just common sense .  believe me ,  i will never watch garden state 2 :  garden salad ,  wedding crashers 2 :  here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring .  now back to this movie ,  in regards to saint405's comment above ,  i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked  " stupid "  by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me ,  everyone did a great job .  the actor who played ricky  ( i forgot his name )  did a very good job .  i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .  anywho ,  i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this ,  bring on the sequel !  !  !  i'm out .  jerzee representin' !
